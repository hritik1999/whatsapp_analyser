[13/01/24, 5:31:13 PM] ~ Fasih Naqvi: Ok
[13/01/24, 5:35:14 PM] ~ Dharmik Patel: Even week 2 pre processing they taught kind of useless for that review column and stuff
[13/01/24, 5:48:35 PM] ~ Priyanshi: Then Any other resources to refer? ‎<This message was edited>
[13/01/24, 5:52:02 PM] ~ Dharmik Patel: well i want to know as well.. i took mlp in this term
[13/01/24, 5:53:12 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: First two weeks have most of the APis that are required.
[13/01/24, 6:00:27 PM] ~ ~A: Yes kahan se mila?
[13/01/24, 6:05:30 PM] ~ ~A: How? I'm getting 0.76
[13/01/24, 6:15:00 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: At this pace, it seems that most active players will finish the project by Monday. 😂
[13/01/24, 6:24:43 PM] ~ Sachin Mishra: Is there any advantage to finish the project by Monday or before the deadline?
[13/01/24, 6:25:55 PM] ~ ~A: There is for the rest if us. We can copy your approach.
[13/01/24, 6:40:25 PM] ~ kotlasaisaranreddy: For validation accuracy is 0.838
But after submission the accuracy is 0.08 🥲
[13/01/24, 6:43:28 PM] ~ Dharmik Patel: wtf
[13/01/24, 6:43:40 PM] ~ Dharmik Patel: 80 to 8 ..
sounds like my life dude
[13/01/24, 6:55:51 PM] ~ Ganesh P: But leaderboard shows 0.78 for #1

[13/01/24, 8:48:32 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Wtf🥲
[13/01/24, 8:48:53 PM] ~ kotlasaisaranreddy: Did you try submitting?
[13/01/24, 8:49:06 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: How did you able to submit? Didn't you face duplicate id issue?
[13/01/24, 8:49:32 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yeah, facing duplicate id's issue
[13/01/24, 8:50:24 PM] ~ kotlasaisaranreddy: Try changing the submission.csv file format
[13/01/24, 8:51:16 PM] ~ kotlasaisaranreddy: index = False
Use parameter
[13/01/24, 8:52:18 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Naa bro, all of us are stuck. Dataset is so much shitty, it will take astronomical efforts to get decent grade in mlp project this term🥹
[13/01/24, 8:53:35 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: That's why people have started early. You won't be able to finish with this dataset if you delay
[13/01/24, 8:54:44 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Where to set this?

[13/01/24, 9:19:37 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I will not put any effort before 19th. This is term break. We are supposed to relax.
[13/01/24, 9:19:59 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I have made a dummy submission. Rest after 19th.
[13/01/24, 9:20:00 PM] ~ Ganesh P: You are in degree level right?
[13/01/24, 9:20:38 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Not yet. This is last term of diploma.
[13/01/24, 9:35:27 PM] ~ Priyanshi: Is it required to do now only or after week 1?
[13/01/24, 9:36:47 PM] ~ Ganesh P: It'll take a very short time.. It is like "hello world" for MLP project on Kaggle..

Nike
[13/01/24, 9:36:57 PM] ~ Ganesh P: *Just do it
[13/01/24, 9:46:16 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: To avoid last minute hiccups.. it's better to do it early. I liked the analogy given by @919914204224 ...it just a Hello world version.
[13/01/24, 9:48:18 PM] ~ Pawan: Really??
[13/01/24, 9:56:26 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: You just hard code the prediction and submit it. I hardcoded 5.
[13/01/24, 10:49:37 PM] ~ Aryan: How many attributes u r droping in this project...like comment id, user id...may be this will not effect result???
[13/01/24, 10:51:22 PM] ~ Vasista: I used all the features and got an accuracy of .64 dropped user Id recipe Name and commentID the accuracy dropped to .59
[13/01/24, 10:52:41 PM] ~ Aryan: this project is based on natural language processing(NLP) ....data preprocessing is everything in this typo
[13/01/24, 10:53:08 PM] ~ Aryan: which model you are applying here?
[13/01/24, 10:53:23 PM] ~ Vasista: Dummy classifier
[13/01/24, 10:54:52 PM] ~ Aryan: Good data preprocessing will increase accuracy
[13/01/24, 11:06:54 PM] ~ Yash Jain: Can we use NLP though?
[13/01/24, 11:09:09 PM] ~ Aryan: I think we should preprocessed with hekp nlp
[13/01/24, 11:09:26 PM] ~ Yash Jain: I mean is using NLP allowed?
[13/01/24, 11:09:34 PM] ~ Yash Jain: Will IITM accept?

[14/01/24, 11:53:53 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: (1) Start with grading document. It has link to MLP project document. Read it. Create kaggle account and make a dummy submission just to check that everything works. (2) start watching first 2 weeks videos on YT. (3) Follow the milestones from project document (yet to be defined)
[14/01/24, 11:54:35 AM] ~ 𝒰𝓇𝒿𝒶𝓈𝓌𝒾 𝐵𝒶𝓃𝑒𝓇𝒿𝑒𝑒: Tysm

is there anyone in the offline campus of any engineering or business colleges..?
preferably tier 1?
[14/01/24, 12:18:47 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Did you watch the video provided in project document? They have shown how to make a submission.
[14/01/24, 12:19:15 PM] ~ Vishwatej: Okok i will watch that
[14/01/24, 12:20:57 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: All, please go through the project document and watch the video provided by iitm.
[14/01/24, 12:44:47 PM] ~ Yash Jain: VIT yes.
[14/01/24, 12:45:01 PM] ~ 𝒰𝓇𝒿𝒶𝓈𝓌𝒾 𝐵𝒶𝓃𝑒𝓇𝒿𝑒𝑒: Can anyone give competition link
[14/01/24, 12:45:21 PM] ~ 𝒰𝓇𝒿𝒶𝓈𝓌𝒾 𝐵𝒶𝓃𝑒𝓇𝒿𝑒𝑒: In the vid it says e-commerce and in guideline it says good cullinary
[14/01/24, 12:45:27 PM] ~ 𝒰𝓇𝒿𝒶𝓈𝓌𝒾 𝐵𝒶𝓃𝑒𝓇𝒿𝑒𝑒: Which one is the correct one
[14/01/24, 12:47:35 PM] ~ Mas: You can get it mlp project section of grading documents for Jan 2024
[14/01/24, 12:52:40 PM] ~ ~Kareena: Is there anything to be done after this? I did this and still can’t see teams tab
[14/01/24, 12:57:15 PM] ~ Akshay Nanda: may be useful... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCJHtHzBVxw
[14/01/24, 1:01:07 PM] ~ Shreya Dey: is there anyone here who is doing MLP and MLP project together?i am feeling clueless on the discussions going on in this group. Any proper guideline on how to start this project
[14/01/24, 1:01:59 PM] ~ Shreya Dey: also the professor is just reading slides in MLP Lecture. how will this be useful for the project?not able to understand where to start
[14/01/24, 1:04:01 PM] ~ 𝒰𝓇𝒿𝒶𝓈𝓌𝒾 𝐵𝒶𝓃𝑒𝓇𝒿𝑒𝑒: Me even I am confused
[14/01/24, 1:04:19 PM] ~ 𝒰𝓇𝒿𝒶𝓈𝓌𝒾 𝐵𝒶𝓃𝑒𝓇𝒿𝑒𝑒: I can’t find the join button on the competition and I don’t know what to do
[14/01/24, 1:21:36 PM] ~ Ganesh P: If you have taken theory and project together, then start going through the slides quickly.
Finish first week (I think that gives overview of entire pipeline), then go to weeks with classification algos.
Don't wait for lectures to start.
[14/01/24, 1:22:07 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Did you go thru the project document and video? MLP theory does not provide any guidance for project. So you are not at a loss.
[14/01/24, 1:22:08 PM] ~ Ganesh P: During term break, play with sklearn.
ML project is basically using sklearn library to easily implement ML stuff you have already learnt. Nothing more.
[14/01/24, 1:23:11 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Yes, and go through the project doc in detail.
Also, look at their milestones and use that as a guide. But shift the timeline earlier. I mean be 2 weeks ahead of it
[14/01/24, 1:24:47 PM] ~ Shreya Dey: Thanks a lot eveyone👍👍
[14/01/24, 1:24:55 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Guys I am getting duplicate ids error while submitting my csv😞. Can someone help who successfully submitted prediction csv? ‎<This message was edited>
[14/01/24, 1:25:58 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I did a dummy submission with unique IDs running from 1-4546. It worked.
[14/01/24, 1:26:18 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Send these

pred_df.head(10)
pred_df.tail(10)
[14/01/24, 1:26:26 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: But in test.csv id's are not unique
[14/01/24, 1:27:00 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: That's why my submission worked and your didn't.
[14/01/24, 1:27:02 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Wait.. Which IDs are you talking about?
[14/01/24, 1:27:34 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: There is an ID field which is not unique.
[14/01/24, 1:27:41 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Ids that are in test.csv. you have to make ratings prediction using test.csv right?
[14/01/24, 1:27:46 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: And there are no duplicate records.
[14/01/24, 1:28:11 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Yes, that's what we are supposed to do.
[14/01/24, 1:29:22 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes I did that only. I trained my model on train data. Then ran my trained model on test csv to generate prediction csv which contains two columns i.e ID and ratings
[14/01/24, 1:30:14 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: But it's showing duplicate id's error because there are duplicate ids in test.csv
[14/01/24, 1:30:23 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Try with unique IDs from 1-4546.
[14/01/24, 1:31:58 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: How much score did you get on dummy submission?
[14/01/24, 1:32:06 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Kaggle competitions (and data science in general) have a little bit of crime investigations involved in them. You do not have full info. So, you have to form a picture of crime scene first.
‎[14/01/24, 1:32:49 PM] ~ :): ‎sticker omitted
[14/01/24, 1:32:57 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Something like 0.7606. Several students have that score. I guess they all hardcoded rating 5.
[14/01/24, 1:34:49 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Projects fail sometimes...not due to lack of tech knowledge...they fail due to bad project management.
[14/01/24, 1:35:27 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Those who are new...I recommend you to read a little bit about CRISP-DM.
[14/01/24, 1:36:27 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: The steps there are better than what is taught in MLP theory.
[14/01/24, 1:36:54 PM] ~ Ganesh P: What's CRISP-DM?
[14/01/24, 1:37:12 PM] ~ Aryan: exactly...i hv tried random forest classifier and accuracy is 0.76 
while on rating 5 its f1 score is 0.87
[14/01/24, 1:37:34 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Most widely used framework/methodology for data mining.
[14/01/24, 1:38:00 PM] ~ Aryan: in this I drop maximum attributes...and work on last 6 attributes approx
[14/01/24, 1:38:51 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: You are jumping into modelling too soon. Brute force approach works only if you have huge compute power.
[14/01/24, 1:39:35 PM] ~ Aryan: what type of brute force ? for dummyclassifier it gives accuracy 0.59
[14/01/24, 1:40:08 PM] ~ Aryan: i will try to finish my mlp project within a week...will not take so much time...
[14/01/24, 1:40:55 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Trying out multiple models in first week of project... that's brute force. Go for 80% analysis and 20% modelling.
[14/01/24, 1:42:16 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Often, in the beginning, the swimming coach will tell you to swim with only leg movement and no movement of arms. Same way, let use only legs in the first few weeks.
[14/01/24, 1:42:35 PM] ~ Aryan: i am implementing everything in colab...not on kaggle....wnna try to analyse that project...will not submit too early....first will finish on colab
[14/01/24, 1:43:11 PM] ~ Aryan: haha...can understand...Great
[14/01/24, 1:43:23 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Some ids are not present between 1 to 4546 in test.csv .How to make predictions for missing ids? 😞😞
[14/01/24, 1:43:34 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Anyone?
[14/01/24, 1:44:32 PM] ~ Aryan: I think there is not any role of id, comment id , user id, and many more ...i hv tried on 6 attributes only
[14/01/24, 1:45:06 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Make a data frame. Put unique IDs in one column and put your predictions in other. Assume that row number of test data is it's ID (starting from 1).
[14/01/24, 1:45:32 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Bro your final submission csv must have two columns id and ratings. So there is big role of id
[14/01/24, 1:46:00 PM] ~ Aryan: okay okay thanks...will take care of that
[14/01/24, 1:46:47 PM] ~ Aryan: I only play with data...checking the things...what should be do in project...so today I played with it...
[14/01/24, 1:47:45 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: But how can you predict the ratings for id's that are missing in test.csv using the model you trained on train data. You just harcoded prediction, but we have to make predictions by running the trained model right ‎<This message was edited>
[14/01/24, 1:49:59 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Arey bhai, try kar ke dekho. Tabhi to pata chalega. Assume that the row number is your record ID in output. It may work. It may not.
[14/01/24, 1:50:50 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: I know it will work. But you will get 0.76 something score, what's the use of it ‎<This message was edited>
[14/01/24, 1:51:46 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: You will not get 0.76. I guess you are making real predictions. You should get better score.
[14/01/24, 1:52:08 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: 0.76 comes with dummy hardcoded prediction.
[14/01/24, 1:52:38 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: If you are using forests or other classifiers, you will have different score.
[14/01/24, 1:52:40 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: I am trying to make prediction using my traines model, but since some Id's are missing in test.csv, trained model cannot predict ratings for the id's whose data is missing
[14/01/24, 1:53:19 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Are bro, vo sab kar liya, model bhi train hogaya. But yaha toh data hi missing hae
[14/01/24, 1:53:21 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Just make prediction for every row of test data and put the row number as ID.
[14/01/24, 1:53:55 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Hmm ok will try that
[14/01/24, 1:54:33 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: It might be expecting row number instead of id
[14/01/24, 1:55:13 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Yes that's the hypothesis. Tell us whether it is correct or not.
[14/01/24, 1:55:42 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: If your score improves then you have evidence.
[14/01/24, 1:57:33 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, because putting same Id's in submission csv as in test.csv will not work since it is expecting unique values. So in submission csv in ID column, it must be expecting row numbers ‎<This message was edited>
[14/01/24, 2:10:22 PM] ~ 𝒰𝓇𝒿𝒶𝓈𝓌𝒾 𝐵𝒶𝓃𝑒𝓇𝒿𝑒𝑒: Guys it shows solution and submission values for ID do not match and gives error while submitting
[14/01/24, 2:26:06 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, it worked. It is expecting row numbers instead of test.csv ids
[14/01/24, 2:45:31 PM] ~ Asad Khan: Anyone please arrange a g-meet and show us from beginning. I am still unable to figure out how to start the project

[14/01/24, 6:41:38 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Model selection comes last.
Think of all the other steps before model selection.
[14/01/24, 6:42:43 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Preprocessing
Understand relationship between features and labels individually
Look at distribution of labels
Think of methods to address class imbalance

[14/01/24, 7:33:58 PM] ~ kotlasaisaranreddy: I have an idea regarding that
Train the data using ratings 1 to 5
Then apply the model and replace data of 0 ratings

[14/01/24, 9:02:17 PM] ~ Aronyak: I have not worked on the project yet but just doing some basic eda reveals the skewness in the data. Also for such a classification model, I feel like trying ensemble gradient boosted trees would yield satisfactory results as I have learnt from my exp. The low accuracy for most submissions is understandable because I think to extract the information from the review text, it's better to use a Naive Bayes or gaussian naive bayesian approach to predict text sentiment. That could be a  sub model inside the final rating prediction model. Also, due to the skewness in target variable, proper feature selection/dimensionality reduction, cross validation and hyper parameter tuning is required to reduce the over fitting.
Also, imo, the ID columns won't yield any significant feature importance so better to drop.
One might also try a neural net based approach for this.

[14/01/24, 9:10:19 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Can't use sentiment analysis for review column because they specifically mentioned in doc not to use libraries like textBlob

[14/01/24, 9:11:59 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: If they wanted sentiment analysis, they would have allowed text blob

[14/01/24, 9:16:41 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Hmm. will try to generate sentiment score from review column using sentiment analysis. That might improve accuracy

[14/01/24, 9:37:40 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Are you going to train that sub model standalone or drive all in one chain ?
[14/01/24, 9:39:48 PM] ~ Aronyak: Very good point. Completely agreeing. Although this particular dataset doesn't have a lot of missing values/outliers imo.
[14/01/24, 9:40:59 PM] ~ Aronyak: Another quick suggestion, for categorical vars, one can try WOE transformation and see if that helps. That will help in binning and light GBM works well with that.
[14/01/24, 9:42:17 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I have not analysed data. But I believe that they would have given clean data but it may require tricky modelling.
[14/01/24, 9:44:48 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I heard that kaggle winners often use woe stuff. They rarely do OHE. .
[14/01/24, 9:46:10 PM] ~ Aronyak: Exactly. When I deal with real world data, a lot more data transformations, adding derived attributes are required. Additionally, generally I've seen models starting an initial feature set of 200-300 vars. This one is simpler but it begs the question about how many features are enough to have a good predictive power. Feature/Gain importance could be used to check that.
[14/01/24, 9:48:46 PM] ~ Aronyak: Yep. Ohe is very basic and it doesn't preserve the magnitude of the value. It classifies based on cardinality not ordinality.
[14/01/24, 9:49:44 PM] ~ Aronyak: WOE can also be used to calculate IV which is imp for feature selection

[14/01/24, 10:36:25 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: I feel selecting these two is very important step
[14/01/24, 10:50:08 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: They taught us about feature selection. Did you try any of that stuff?
[14/01/24, 10:54:24 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Take the following general approach

Categorize vars into:
Cat, num vars
Text var

For cat/num vars, do univariate analysis with label yo see which are correlated/associated well.
For text var, experiment with different encodings. Try to understand text-label association in isolation before clubbing it with other vars.
[14/01/24, 10:54:36 PM] ~ Aronyak: Yes absolutely. But, there is a lot more to do with the data but I don't see much scope for preprocessing. The review column definitely could be vectorised/transformed.
[14/01/24, 10:55:06 PM] ~ Aronyak: Weight of evidence
[14/01/24, 10:56:24 PM] ~ Aronyak: Don't do it intuitively, I guess. Use statistical approaches. PCA could work. Feature selection is an art rather than a set few steps. Use whatever floats your boat.
[14/01/24, 10:59:36 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: ok
[14/01/24, 10:59:48 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Thanks👍
[14/01/24, 11:00:53 PM] ~ Ganesh P: When you are dealing with text, it is an order of magnitude more work than other ML projects.
Simply because we don't know text preprocessing. Also, there's library restrictions.
So, be patient and put in the work. It is not going to be as simple as the last one.

[15/01/24, 11:31:38 AM] ~ Ganesh P: Why did you drop/ignore 0 ratings?
The sample.csv shows 0 ratings which means we need to predict that.

One issue is, in data description, they have said ratings range from 1 to 5.
Has anyone clarified this disparity on discourse with MLP project team?
[15/01/24, 11:32:10 AM] ~ Ganesh P: Rating 5 for everything will give a score of 0.7605.

[15/01/24, 11:32:14 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, Range might be wrong
[15/01/24, 11:33:27 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, I know. Issue is trained models performs very poorly for ratings other than 5

[15/01/24, 12:07:59 PM] ~ Ganesh P: The problem you are trying to solve is class imbalance I believe.
Skew has a different meaning na.. Skew is a term associated with continuous data. That's where these transformations help.
If you find a feature is heavily skewed, you will transform it.

Here, the problem is class imbalance in labels.
[15/01/24, 12:08:30 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Exactly what I am trying to say
[15/01/24, 12:08:57 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Ohh okay, got it. Our data is not continuous
[15/01/24, 12:09:10 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Class imbalance is the right term
[15/01/24, 12:10:45 PM] ~ Ganesh P: MLP project needs us to use a lot of what we learnt right from statistics 1&2..
First step is, understand the data. Dedicate one day just to look at the data.
Kaggle itself gives you a simple summary on "data" tab.. Go thru it
[15/01/24, 12:12:15 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, I guess 80-90 percent of efforts will go down in pre-processing
[15/01/24, 12:12:36 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Specially handling class imbalance issue
[15/01/24, 12:12:50 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Which is major concern🫠😞
[15/01/24, 12:15:53 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Then try to summarize

How many rows?
How many features?
How many classes in label? What is their distribution? 
Which column has unique values?
What is the distribution of each continuous feature? 
How many categories and how are they distributed for each cat var?
Read description of each variable and try to understand qualitatively how it will affect the label i.e., rating?
Think like a domain expert and make a list of variables which will be important (before statistical approaches).
Then use statistical approaches, and see it they match your expert views. If there's a difference, try to understand why there's a difference.
Then see how each var is related to label.
Understand what label 0 means and how important it is. If in doubt, post in discourse.
And so on
[15/01/24, 12:16:49 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Observe that there's still no mention of model
[15/01/24, 12:20:02 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, I am currently trying out extracting important features using Random Forrest Regressor, just to get the idea of feature importances. Gone through the initial distribution analysis of the data ‎<This message was edited>
[15/01/24, 12:20:02 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Next step is the text column
Spend a week to understand text encodings
Merits and demerits of each method
Check out how many features the transformation generates. Compare that with the initial feature number you have now. Think how this change will affect your models. One thing is, it will greatly increase your training time. There are many other learnings there.
[15/01/24, 12:21:27 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Last term project would have taken may be 1 week to get a 0.9+ score if you are decent with sklearn library and preprocessing.
Some did in 2-3 days.

But you have text in this.
So multiply whatever time you would have needed for last term project by 5x.
[15/01/24, 12:21:38 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Min 5x
[15/01/24, 12:22:14 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Again, note that there's still no mention of model
[15/01/24, 12:22:16 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, pata ni mere saath hi aisa kyu hota humesha🫠

[15/01/24, 12:22:35 PM] ~ Ganesh P: You are getting great opportunities.
[15/01/24, 12:23:08 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: One more thing. Be clear about your goal. Are you aiming for high performance model ? Or Are you aiming for ability to generate high performance model ?
[15/01/24, 12:23:39 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Aim for the ability, always.
[15/01/24, 12:23:59 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Muje toh 20x lag raha hae🫠🫠

- Prof Andrew
[15/01/24, 12:25:39 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Quite possible.
On first glance, it looks tougher than the text sentiment analysis project we did 2 terms ago.
And that was the toughest at that time in MLP project history.
[15/01/24, 12:25:52 PM] ~ Ganesh P: *at first glance
[15/01/24, 12:26:24 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Now this term project will go down in history books😂😂
[15/01/24, 12:27:08 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Or on your resume as an accolade

[15/01/24, 12:33:35 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Did you consider library restrictions?
[15/01/24, 12:33:47 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Best score many be 0.85, who knows
[15/01/24, 12:34:25 PM] ~ Ryan Sequeira: After a score, it will take lot more effort to improve on that score
[15/01/24, 12:34:33 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: That's why 0.95+ score people will be legend🫠🫠
[15/01/24, 12:34:40 PM] ~ Ryan Sequeira: Start small and then keep on improving
[15/01/24, 12:35:26 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: 0.85 toh muje bharosa hae multiple people achieve kar lenge
[15/01/24, 12:36:07 PM] ~ Ryan Sequeira: Last to last project mein ek ka 0.85 gaya tha after lot of efforts
[15/01/24, 12:36:29 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Abhi to term shuru bhi nahin hua. So far this is brute force approach. If you do it systematically, you will make progress. Actual score will depend on the data.

[15/01/24, 12:42:02 PM] ~ Ganesh P: But let's see the good things:

You started early and realized that the mountain is much bigger than you thought. That's actually an important step.
Imagine people trying to do this in last 2 weeks.

[18/01/24, 7:37:48 AM] ~ Ganesh P: But i dont fully agree with him. 

As a last step, after all the pre-model steps are optimized, I try other models. It does give improvement. (I am talking in the context of our kaggle MLP projects).
[18/01/24, 9:40:14 AM] ~ vanshikakamboj2001: I took MLP project in previous term but wasn't able to complete it. Now, I want to complete it in this term but it's showing P grade and in completed projects instead of current projects. Should I mail regarding this to them?

[20/01/24, 1:45:45 PM] ~ Ritik Ranjan: 7
[20/01/24, 1:46:44 PM] ~ ravi: Should we deep learn about neural networks and such for this project?
[20/01/24, 1:47:14 PM] ~ ravi: What would u give for other projects??
( Just to compare the ratings for understanding)
[20/01/24, 1:47:47 PM] ~ Ritik Ranjan: Just apply whatever was taught in MLP theory, that would be suffice
[20/01/24, 1:48:09 PM] ~ ravi: U meant mlt theory?
[20/01/24, 1:48:49 PM] ~ Ritik Ranjan: App dev 1 is moderate , app dev 2 is difficult and the heaviest of them all and BDM is also moderate.

Bdm -7??

[20/01/24, 3:58:36 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I can't tell you the exact module but it's in the sklearn library. For NLP tasks
[20/01/24, 3:59:13 PM] ~ Sagar: Oo ok .
[20/01/24, 3:59:15 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: With some hit and trials you'll also get there

[20/01/24, 4:03:56 PM] ~ Sagar: Ok thanks .
[20/01/24, 4:04:03 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: There are several methods to tackle class imbalance. We need to explore that first
[20/01/24, 4:04:32 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Also there are many sampling techniques. Need to explore that as well
[20/01/24, 4:05:29 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Use stratified CV. It equally divides the data class wise At each fold. You'll get better idea about your model performance.
[20/01/24, 4:06:55 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: They have allowed one library called Imblearn. Haven't used it but I'll explore what it could do.
[20/01/24, 4:07:48 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: ....
[20/01/24, 4:10:47 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Imblearn also have SMOTE

[20/01/24, 4:12:35 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes. I am also exploring this. I think we should focus on pre-processing more
[20/01/24, 4:13:06 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: This dataset requires god level pre-processing🙂 ‎<This message was edited>

[20/01/24, 5:01:56 PM] ~ Sagar: did they added us in gspace ? too
[20/01/24, 5:16:37 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Guys, one suggestion - use imblearn library and try the random oversampler method. I am observing the drastic improvement in accuracy (0.9+ for logistic regression). Haven't submitted that to portal yet. Let's see the actual score after submission ‎<This message was edited>
[20/01/24, 5:17:26 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: And text vectorizer for review column
[20/01/24, 5:17:54 PM] ~ Sagar: And drop those columns which have null values in review columns

[20/01/24, 5:27:00 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: It seems like this mlp project strongly follows "bad data leads to bad results" principal 🙂. 
No matter what models you try and how much hyper parameters tunning you do, unless you convert bad data into good data, you won't get results
[20/01/24, 5:27:01 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Isko topper ghoshit kar dena chahiye. Bada punya ka kaam kar raha hai yeh.
[20/01/24, 5:27:33 PM] ~ Sagar: 🤣🤣

[20/01/24, 5:30:54 PM] ~ Ganesh P: What about 0?
[20/01/24, 5:31:49 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: 0 ratings?
[20/01/24, 5:32:22 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Not submitted yet. Hope portal score doesn't drop much🫠🫠 ‎<This message was edited>
[20/01/24, 5:46:29 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: During viva, do we show only the submission notebook or can we show multiple notebooks? Do we have to put EDA in main notebook or can I keep separate notebook for EDA?
[20/01/24, 5:47:15 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: It is neat if we keep EDA and modelling in separate notebooks.
[20/01/24, 5:47:57 PM] ~ Khushi Singh: I have taken this project for the first time in Jan term ... What is the difficulty level of this project and any guidance regarding this?
[20/01/24, 5:59:49 PM] ~ adityamalik: This was the thinking during may term project also in early days🫠
[20/01/24, 6:00:16 PM] ~ adityamalik: You can show any particular single notebook that you want to show
[20/01/24, 6:01:11 PM] ~ adityamalik: But,you likely wouldn't get the notebook marks based on your 2 different notebooks🫠
[20/01/24, 6:02:26 PM] ~ adityamalik: Sample is just for reference,how the submission file should be
[20/01/24, 6:04:30 PM] ~ adityamalik: That's where the whole crux of the competition and ml lies ‎<This message was edited>

[20/01/24, 6:49:30 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I've earlier read in Quora that for sparse matrix use lasso+boosting algorithm. It works well.
After vectorization and preprocessing I have more than 10k feats left so, try using it Lovin. I think you can get very good results with it ‎<This message was edited>
[20/01/24, 6:50:58 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes will try that👍
[20/01/24, 6:51:04 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I'll also start working ASAP
[20/01/24, 6:53:18 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Overfitting might be the issue. Regularlization (Lasso) might be the key
[20/01/24, 6:55:09 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-machine-learning-model-for-a-very-sparse-and-highly-dimensional-feature-set
[20/01/24, 6:55:10 PM] ~ Lx: Step 1

Plot correlation heat map for numerical features wrt rating ....numerical features are not so important. 

Means only categorical features are important
[20/01/24, 6:55:55 PM] ~ Lx: Step 2: 
Focus on categorical features
[20/01/24, 6:55:58 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes did that. Only Categorical features shows strong correlation
[20/01/24, 6:55:59 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: We don't have any categorical feats
[20/01/24, 6:56:09 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I guess
[20/01/24, 6:56:10 PM] ~ Lx: 🤣🤣🤣
[20/01/24, 6:56:44 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Recipe review comes under which category? ‎<This message was edited>
[20/01/24, 6:57:22 PM] ~ Ritik Ranjan: Textual data
[20/01/24, 6:57:25 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Recipe review is the only column with strong correlation
[20/01/24, 6:57:53 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Text and categorical data are different
[20/01/24, 6:58:26 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: What are the categorical cols ?
[20/01/24, 6:58:39 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: How did you find this correlation?
[20/01/24, 6:59:00 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Best score, thumbs up count, thumbs down count , reply count have weak correlation ‎<This message was edited>
[20/01/24, 6:59:42 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Plot correlation matrix
[20/01/24, 7:00:07 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: There are several methods available
[20/01/24, 7:01:45 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: You can plot only numerical values. Correlation can be found only for numerical values. How did you do that for text?
[20/01/24, 7:04:05 PM] ~ Nayana Ragesh: Hey... Is there any null values in the review column? I didn't find any.. I got 2 null values in the rating column only. And all other columns have no null. Please confirm.. I want to know if I am making any mistakes..
[20/01/24, 7:20:28 PM] ~ Pranav Swaminathan: Guys, are you all able to access the MLP project from the iitm dashboard?

[20/01/24, 8:45:53 PM] ~ Ganesh P: All in same notebook
[20/01/24, 8:49:17 PM] ~ Ganesh P: SAMPLE.CSV file has 0-6 as outputs.
Your predictions have 1-5 na?
[20/01/24, 8:50:11 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes
[20/01/24, 8:50:28 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: 1-5 ratings only
[20/01/24, 8:57:32 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Have you checked sample.csv?
[20/01/24, 9:02:18 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, it contains 0 ratings as well, but in problem statement range is mentioned 1-5 which is contradictory
[20/01/24, 9:02:39 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: They haven't clarified on this point yet ‎<This message was edited>

[20/01/24, 9:10:40 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Is there any doubt clearing session where we can ask our doubts?

[20/01/24, 9:19:11 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Btw how did you exclude 0 rating from your training and training predictions?
[20/01/24, 9:19:51 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Just dropped 0 ratings rows in train.csv ‎<This message was edited>
[20/01/24, 9:20:03 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Zero is present in test dataset. I verified using forensics.
[20/01/24, 9:20:30 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Woah😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
[20/01/24, 9:20:38 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: forensics?

[20/01/24, 9:21:38 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I have been asking  to focus on analysis instead of modelling. First step is to understand the data.
[20/01/24, 9:22:13 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I had mentioned earlier that DS is like crime investigations.
[20/01/24, 9:22:39 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Don't assume. Only observe.
[20/01/24, 9:22:49 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: But how did you identify 0 ratings data present in test dataset? 🤯🤯
[20/01/24, 9:23:08 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: If you do not know the distribution of test data how will you create your validation set.
[20/01/24, 9:23:36 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Test has exactly same  distribution as training. Zero included.
[20/01/24, 9:23:36 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Test.csv don't have Ratings column right? ‎<This message was edited>

[20/01/24, 9:25:45 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Are bro, aap train.csv ki hi baat kar rahe ho kya? We divide train.csv into train and validation sets in some ratio. Usually 0.2 test data and 0.8 train data ‎<This message was edited>

[20/01/24, 9:26:58 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Usme toh obviously same hoga naa
[20/01/24, 9:27:21 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Let us get the terminology correct. We split train data in to train and validation set. Test data is used for leadership board. We have to proceed on the basis of validation set.
[20/01/24, 9:27:47 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, are you talking about validation set? ‎<This message was edited>
[20/01/24, 9:28:11 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: We need to estimate the distribution of ratings in test file which is used for leadership... the hidden ratings.
[20/01/24, 9:28:27 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Validation set will obviously have the same distribution as train data
[20/01/24, 9:29:09 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Validation set is created by us. No need to investigate that. Test data is the mystery. It has same distribution as training.

[20/01/24, 9:30:50 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Don't assume that zero is invalid.
[20/01/24, 9:31:02 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, I know test data is the mystery. It's the test data ratings that we have to predict. But, how do you know for sure test data will have 0 ratings ‎<This message was edited>
[20/01/24, 9:32:59 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Try what I am saying. Consider zero as valid. That will improve your score. If it works then you can trust this piece of knowledge.
[20/01/24, 9:33:17 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Hmm, ok I will try
[20/01/24, 9:33:38 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: But I will also ask this doubt in session just to clarify
[20/01/24, 9:33:45 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Don't assume. Don't blindly follow others. Verify yourself and reach your own conclusion.

[23/01/24, 10:29:53 PM] ~ ravi: But still i have seen people doin this with theory as well

So i would recomend u to deep dive into unsupervised , supervised learning in sklearn

Study how to do

Ridge, lasso regression /classification

Sgd regression /classification

Grid search cv , randomised search cv , 

Perceptron

Svm

Decisin trees , Random forest 

Bagging , boosting

Multi layer perceptron/ nueral networks

in sklearn .

Also study how to do a preprocessing

[24/01/24, 11:02:16 AM] ~ Khushi Kanade: Ok
[24/01/24, 11:02:20 AM] ~ ~Rupak: See..there are 2 cases
1) u registered last term but you didnpt complete the project this project fees is valid for 2 terms.But the course won't auto add in your current projects tab for that u have to register and give then RKA fees 1000 rs(which would be refunded).
2) you are doing project 1st tym..then it would show up on your portal by tmrw
[24/01/24, 11:03:18 AM] ~ ~Rupak: I have done it..just now and Confirmed this twice..RKA is paid just to mark your presence for the term and they would refund it as per their roll out
[24/01/24, 11:04:00 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: No no. The first case isn't like that. I couldn't finish it last term so they've asked to wait till today, it'll be carried forward
[24/01/24, 11:04:37 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: RKA is for term drop na? Why would one need to pay RKA to continue a project which was registered last term?
[24/01/24, 11:04:58 AM] ~ mansi: Same doubt
[24/01/24, 11:05:00 AM] ~ mansi: ..
[24/01/24, 11:05:10 AM] ~ mansi: If have to pay kaha krna hai
[24/01/24, 11:05:14 AM] ~ ~Rupak: See, I am telling you what they told me.and what I paid
[24/01/24, 11:05:32 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: Did you take a term break?
[24/01/24, 11:05:39 AM] ~ ~Rupak: Through course registration.tab
[24/01/24, 11:05:44 AM] ~ ~Rupak: No
[24/01/24, 11:06:06 AM] ~ ~Rupak: My theory courses are done..may be that's why they told me to do
[24/01/24, 11:06:07 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: Have you registered for any theory subject this term?
[24/01/24, 11:06:12 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: Right
[24/01/24, 11:07:07 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: That's the issue. So if one is done with all the theory courses and is left with nothing but the projects, then this RKA thing is applicable.

But if one has registered for theory subjects then it'll follow the regular routine
[24/01/24, 11:07:11 AM] ~ ~Rupak: Plz join this meet to clear your doubts from support team
[24/01/24, 11:07:33 AM] ~ mansi: Timing for this meet
[24/01/24, 11:07:35 AM] ~ mansi: ?
[24/01/24, 11:07:55 AM] ~ ~Rupak: Yes, I think they have this rule or something for person w/o theory courses
[24/01/24, 11:08:07 AM] ~ ~Rupak: Going on till 5 pm
[24/01/24, 11:08:32 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: Yes.
[24/01/24, 11:55:13 AM] ~ mansi: Rka fees kisi na pay krdj hai
[24/01/24, 11:55:15 AM] ~ mansi: To btado
[24/01/24, 11:55:21 AM] ~ mansi: Kaise krni please
[24/01/24, 11:56:09 AM] ~ ravi: i heard , u had to pay rka fees to keep registration , only if u have no theory courses left and only project courses let. aim i right?
[24/01/24, 11:56:26 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: Have you registered for any theory courses?
[24/01/24, 11:56:33 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: Yes
[24/01/24, 11:56:35 AM] ~ mansi: No they are done

[24/01/24, 11:57:11 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: Make up as in you're repeating a theory?
[24/01/24, 11:57:25 AM] ~ mansi: Just end term
[24/01/24, 11:58:18 AM] ~ Nyarlathotep: I'm not sure about that

[26/01/24, 11:11:43 AM] ~ adityamalik: That's also not necessary,both can be done in same term as well
[26/01/24, 11:12:02 AM] ~ adityamalik: I did both together in may 2023 term
[26/01/24, 11:17:26 AM] ~ adityamalik: Also check the milestone deadline dates they have given🙂
[26/01/24, 11:20:03 AM] ~ adityamalik: Also previous term project document was a direct copy of earlier term, classification given there when the project was of regression,and would have taken many days to correct it or don't know if they even edited it by end also,so not an uncommon trait for them to make such mistakes

[28/01/24, 7:41:31 PM] ~ Rohan ❤️: For giving access you can do that by opening the notebook from which you made submission
[28/01/24, 7:43:17 PM] ~ Soham Patra: check it under code

It might sound a dumb question but I just want to know what exactly we have to do in project. Like I have submitted dummy classifier and and changed the team name and notebook name as instructed. Now what?
[28/01/24, 8:42:39 PM] ~ Asad Khan: I have to keep submitting the accuracy score of different models?
[28/01/24, 8:43:31 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: You have to try different models and keep submitting your notebook.
[28/01/24, 8:48:07 PM] ~ Asad Khan: Every time notebook will be different?

[29/01/24, 9:27:13 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: 0.76 means you are predicting everything as 5.

[29/01/24, 9:28:10 PM] ~ :): There's some problem in current grading equation... Meet mein unhone bola they will make correction as needed
[29/01/24, 9:28:23 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: 5 is in 76% of data.
[29/01/24, 9:28:58 PM] ~ ravi: Yeah i know thats from dummy , yeh yeh , but 0.76 doesnt mean it will all be 5s right?
[29/01/24, 9:29:17 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Wrong thing is that you cannot get 100% marks without 100% accuracy. And 100% accuracy is absurd.
[29/01/24, 9:30:05 PM] ~ :): Somebody pointed in the meet that even if someone get 0.9+ accuracy, score is coming around 80.
[29/01/24, 9:30:11 PM] ~ ravi: Just aim for 0.8, it will.be scaled 😎
[29/01/24, 9:30:17 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Why not ?
[29/01/24, 9:30:25 PM] ~ ravi: Or as the weeks go along , the scores will differ

[29/01/24, 10:25:26 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: I would not give viva if my score isn't 0.9+, because I know I won't be getting full in viva + notebook😂
[29/01/24, 10:25:55 PM] ~ adityamalik: It's relative marking,not absolute
[29/01/24, 10:25:58 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: That's the risk I am not willing to take🫠
[29/01/24, 10:26:09 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: It's absolute I think
[29/01/24, 10:26:19 PM] ~ adityamalik: May term project with binary classification had 0.85 as highest score
[29/01/24, 10:26:32 PM] ~ Curious Rohit.: .
[29/01/24, 10:26:57 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Their formula was also different I think. Now it's 30℅ weightage
[29/01/24, 10:27:14 PM] ~ adityamalik: That time also it was 30% weightage
[29/01/24, 10:27:22 PM] ~ Sujay D: @917523078167 give me some Sunshine, give me some rain.
[29/01/24, 10:27:55 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Are you sure marking is relative? ‎<This message was edited>
[29/01/24, 10:29:11 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Because I never ever heard the concept of relative marking in any course or project in IITM🫠
‎[29/01/24, 10:29:28 PM] ~ adityamalik: ‎image omitted
[29/01/24, 10:29:57 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Absolute marking based on accuracy
[29/01/24, 10:30:35 PM] ~ adityamalik: Yeah just saying whatever the highest score would be would very likely get 30
[29/01/24, 10:31:08 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: 0.829 would probably be highest this term😂😂
[29/01/24, 10:31:29 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: No. It just a function of your accuracy and cut-off. No other variable in formula.
[29/01/24, 10:31:46 PM] ~ adityamalik: It's very early in the project,that time also this was the highest at this point of time🙂
[29/01/24, 10:32:56 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: But how come final score is 81? 0.829 score means almost 30℅ marks straight away gone
[29/01/24, 10:33:00 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: 😮😮
[29/01/24, 10:34:27 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: And also viva and notebook marks are not full
[29/01/24, 10:34:31 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: What was the formula in your term ? I heard that in previous terms the formula was pegged to highest scorer.
[29/01/24, 10:36:41 PM] ~ adityamalik: Yeah obviously,37 and 8,10 for cutoff
[29/01/24, 10:36:59 PM] ~ adityamalik: That was previous Jan term
[29/01/24, 10:37:37 PM] ~ adityamalik: And also the formula that they have given in document,they very likely had used a different one,and this time different would be used very likely
[29/01/24, 10:38:44 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: This time 77 accuracy brings 0 marks and 100 accuracy brings 30 marks. Plus 10 marks for crossing cutoff.
[29/01/24, 10:38:48 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: If they pegged to highest scorer instead of 100 in the formula, then only 81 score was possible, otherwise not possible ‎<This message was edited>
[29/01/24, 10:40:25 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: So maybe in previous terms they took the highest score in the formula instead of calculating it from 100
[29/01/24, 10:41:21 PM] ~ Ganesh P: They will never calculate it from 100
[29/01/24, 10:41:59 PM] ~ adityamalik: Maybe @919914204224 can share his mlp project marks breakdown,who was #5👀🙂
[29/01/24, 10:43:30 PM] ~ Ganesh P: What was the "Subject" for this email? Lemme search
[29/01/24, 10:43:56 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yeah this time 77 accuracy brings 0 out of 30🥹. Our only hope is to hope they calculate it from the highest score and not from 100 ‎<This message was edited>
[29/01/24, 10:44:54 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: And 0.829 will probably bring about just 4-5 marks ‎<This message was edited>

[29/01/24, 10:51:27 PM] ~ adityamalik: Looks like a 29 for kaggle score out of 30🙂
[29/01/24, 10:52:09 PM] ~ adityamalik: 93 was final project score?
[29/01/24, 10:52:20 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Yes
[29/01/24, 10:52:37 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes, they must have calculated it from the highest score surely and not from 100 ‎<This message was edited>
[29/01/24, 10:52:52 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Yes
[29/01/24, 10:54:17 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: But iss term me shayad aisa naa kare🫠
[29/01/24, 10:54:27 PM] ~ adityamalik: That's why I had said relative marking according to highest score
[29/01/24, 10:54:35 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: ...
[29/01/24, 10:56:15 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: They are just making illogical decisions in project grading from this jan term just in the name of increasing quality😂
[29/01/24, 10:57:14 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Toh iss term sabke C or D wali situation bhi aajae toh shock nahi lagega
[29/01/24, 10:57:59 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Nothing like that will happen
[29/01/24, 10:58:04 PM] ~ adityamalik: D,E vaala pichle term se hi toh kar diya tha baad mein,baccho ko pass karvane ke liye 🫠
[29/01/24, 10:58:06 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Scoring formula will change
[29/01/24, 10:58:20 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Stop worrying about the formula and just give your best in the project
[29/01/24, 10:58:52 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Let's hope, otherwise very difficult to cross C grade🙂
[29/01/24, 11:03:26 PM] ~ Akshat: Bro the term has just started
[29/01/24, 11:03:34 PM] ~ Akshat: You have been so negative since the start of this month
[29/01/24, 11:03:58 PM] ~ Akshat: Things will get cleared as we move on
[29/01/24, 11:04:42 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Most people haven't even started.
[29/01/24, 11:05:29 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Right now every one is just making the dummy submission (except for 2-3 racers)
[29/01/24, 11:06:08 PM] ~ Akshat: I did grid search and got only 0.76
Feature engineering will be the game changer
[29/01/24, 11:07:08 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: I am not negative bro. Just frustrated for now because I tried almost everything and still not able to get 0.8+ score🫠
[29/01/24, 11:07:48 PM] ~ Akshat: Understandable
[29/01/24, 11:09:52 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: And 0.9+ score does not seems logical this term, but IITM have framed the formula in such a way that one has to score 0.9+ to get a good grade. It seems like they expect majority of us crossing 0.9+ score🫠🫠
[29/01/24, 11:11:10 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: But let's hope they change it soon🫠🫠
[29/01/24, 11:12:46 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Feature engineering also I tried🫠🫠

[01/02/24, 2:11:48 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: It is based on the formula mentioned in project document.
[01/02/24, 2:13:02 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Someone was saying that they'll round off based on the highest score
[01/02/24, 2:18:41 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Does it matter what I or you or someone else is saying? It matters only when iitm says.
[01/02/24, 2:19:12 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Point 👉
[01/02/24, 2:19:49 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Then 30 marks are washed away straight away
[01/02/24, 2:23:46 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Most people are focusing on 30 marks. When I point out that you can still get 70 marks just by reaching cut-off...guess what reaction I get ? They are confident that they will not get those 70 marks. Yet they are not bothered about 70, but bothered about 30.
[01/02/24, 2:28:18 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Still if we're not confident with our model and it isn't performing well on data then obviously we'll get demotivated and knowing that after putting so much effort we'll never get good grades, it'll recede your performance more.
[01/02/24, 2:30:46 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: No data scientist is confident about a that has not been built. This is not engineering, it is science. Unfortunately, this is being pursued like engineering.

[01/02/24, 2:38:06 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I totally get your point but I'm talking about the moral of us students. Iitm should provide us some more resources and mentoring to handle such a tricky situation. Lot of us don't even know how to run kaggle properly and expect us to handle the NLP problem without any suitable library.
[01/02/24, 2:38:49 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: This is not an NLP problem.
[01/02/24, 2:40:29 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: It is... Model performance isn't increasing until and unless you do proper feature extraction from the textual data
[01/02/24, 2:43:59 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: That does not make it NLP. Just because we have to extract features from text...it doesn't mean that it is NLP.
[01/02/24, 2:45:18 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Lot of students talk about sentiment analysis. Rating 5&4 both have positive sentiment. How does that help you?
[01/02/24, 2:46:30 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Subjective opinion
[01/02/24, 2:49:57 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: That's one way to handle this since we are dealing with multinomial predictions of recipe ratings. But it's not sufficient.

[01/02/24, 3:57:50 PM] ~ ravi: Natural language processing
[01/02/24, 4:22:30 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Bro, be practical. You can get 70 marks but it would be extremely difficult and at the end only a few will get a full 70 marks. It's not like IITM is distributing halwa and everyone will get 70 😂. 30 marks is a lot for someone who is not an expert in ML and doing it for the first time
[01/02/24, 4:23:48 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Ask the value of 30 marks from someone who will get 40 or 50 out of 70🙂
[01/02/24, 5:43:41 PM] ~ Ganesh P: It actually is..
Very crude 20th century NLP may be but it is NLP 😬
[01/02/24, 5:44:59 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Current day NLP is much much advanced.. 
but a most of it cannot be learnt and implemented using allowed libraries in the given time
[01/02/24, 5:46:27 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Vectorization, stemming, lemmatization, phrase identification, etc can be done.. But don't know how relevant it is to current project..
[01/02/24, 5:47:11 PM] ~ Ganesh P: But because there is a text column expressing people's opinion and then it is quantified/classified as a rating, these procedures may be of some help ‎<This message was edited>
[01/02/24, 5:49:05 PM] ~ Ganesh P: I feel you but there is NOT much anyone can do about it.
But i can assure one thing:
It will never happen that no one gets S grade.. Quite a significant number of people will get S.. Grading will be done accordingly.
So do not worry. Do your best.
S is definitely achievable ‎<This message was edited>

[01/02/24, 5:56:21 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: It is not about technology. Generally, when you are dealing with extraction of meaning from text or looking at grammatical structure and sequences then we enter the domain of NLP. Over here we are not interested in meaning, we are only associating the text with ratings. My perspective may be debatable...I acknowledge that.
[01/02/24, 6:29:19 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: One way or another, you are extracting features out of text to make it understandable for the machine and that is what NLP includes.
Primitive or modern every algo or technique is designed to extract features from the text.
[01/02/24, 6:30:42 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Hopefully 🤞
[01/02/24, 6:33:49 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Example : TF-IDF is not dependent on language. But the NLP libraries are language specific.

[01/02/24, 10:17:06 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: IITM milestone deadlines are as unrealistic as their project decisions🫠. If you are wise don't follow them blindly, otherwise it will be very difficult to complete the project in the end, considering the difficulty level of project this term. Start as early as possible ‎<This message was edited>

[01/02/24, 10:45:00 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: So take decisions wisely.
[01/02/24, 10:46:58 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: And you should know your target score ‎<This message was edited>
[01/02/24, 10:47:50 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: So many people have posted here about different models they have tried. Nobody is discussing the EDA or preprocessing or feature engineering. Nobody is talking about strategy. Progress will start once the focus shifts away from modelling and tuning.
[01/02/24, 10:49:11 PM] ~ Sagar: +1 
I have tried literally every model and getting almost same accuracy with them.
And I am pretty sure we have to do good preprocessing cause right now we r using only one feature we have to figure out a way to make use of other features also ‎<This message was edited>
[01/02/24, 10:50:32 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: I have tried random over sampler method of imblearn library, it's performing well on validation set, but performing very poorly on test data. ‎<This message was edited>
[01/02/24, 10:50:54 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: I guess it is overfitting
[01/02/24, 10:51:29 PM] ~ Sagar: Even SVC without sampling technique is overfitting
[01/02/24, 10:51:57 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I am saying - stop modelling. First identify the relevant features or create features. You are always talking about modelling.
[01/02/24, 10:52:50 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: i have talked about it but no one seems intrested
[01/02/24, 10:53:01 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: I stopped focus on modelling way back bro. I am focused on pre-processing for a long time🙂
[01/02/24, 10:53:16 PM] ~ Sagar: About what ?
[01/02/24, 10:53:24 PM] ~ ravi: I have got like 0.75 something no preprocessing , no complex modelling
Happy 😎
[01/02/24, 10:53:52 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: But you are still talking about "it performed well on validation"

[01/02/24, 10:55:29 PM] ~ ravi: Dummy classifier will get removed during final submission

And all the poor performers ( me included 😎) will get a slight nudge (0.1) for better scoring chamces
[01/02/24, 10:55:32 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: about getting consistent precision on all classes by handling imbalance
[01/02/24, 10:55:48 PM] ~ ravi: Really?
[01/02/24, 10:56:13 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Otherwise how will you know your pre-processing steps is working
[01/02/24, 10:56:23 PM] ~ Sagar: Yes cause it was a regression problem and it was too easy just first 4 weeks and u r done .. one of my friend did so ik

Was it always filled with 0.95s or was it 0.8s then gradually increasing

Just ask

[01/02/24, 11:01:54 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: there's too much similar noise in the data which is hindering model to generalize well
[01/02/24, 11:02:40 PM] ~ ravi: Bro ... I hate to say this to you..


Stop whining.. sab ho jayega
.

Be patient , wait a few weeks 

Breathe in 😌
Breathe out 😮‍💨
[01/02/24, 11:02:57 PM] ~ Sagar: @917306102227  my friend said ..it was too bad at the start but gradually got better with the time

[01/02/24, 11:06:26 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: How did you pre-process recipe review column?
[01/02/24, 11:08:03 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: built a custom preprocessor myself

[01/02/24, 11:09:04 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: for cleaning the texts. vectorization is on later stages
[01/02/24, 11:09:38 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: how did you clean the texts? did you use some library?
[01/02/24, 11:10:07 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: regex
[01/02/24, 11:11:08 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Which numerical columns did you took and how you pre-processed them? Standard scaler?
[01/02/24, 11:11:56 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: for removing links, stopwords, non alpha numeric characters, repeating characters, etc
[01/02/24, 11:12:22 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: just 'Recipe_Review' col
[01/02/24, 11:12:31 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: 😮😮😮
[01/02/24, 11:12:51 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: havent used any other cols yet
[01/02/24, 11:12:59 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Try to take numerical columns as well. Accuracy might improve

[01/02/24, 11:14:46 PM] ~ Suga priya: Then thanks for the inputs
[01/02/24, 11:15:19 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: if you explore, you'll see some patterns and unwanted noise in it.
[01/02/24, 11:15:41 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Try to generate sentiment score from cleaned recipe review. Score might improve🙂 ‎<This message was edited>

[01/02/24, 11:18:30 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: vaders is much more powerfull

It is not..
[02/02/24, 12:18:45 AM] ~ Ganesh P: This is the key.
Absolute key.
[02/02/24, 12:22:16 AM] ~ Ganesh P: Straight up it had 0.9+ scores.
It was an easy project.
0.95+ was only 14 people, 0.955+ is only 2
[02/02/24, 12:22:54 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Also you can not fit the sparse matrix (after vectorization) in various models. You have to find a way to reduce either those features or do exhaustive feature extraction from the current data
[02/02/24, 12:27:00 AM] ~ Suga priya: ok

[02/02/24, 11:08:15 AM] ~ ravi: no don't worry , it will get carried forward next term

[02/02/24, 12:12:25 PM] Kavya Iitm: Then fine!😇
[02/02/24, 12:13:04 PM] ~ Sagar: That is the only which we can use .
[02/02/24, 12:13:14 PM] ~ Prachi: Ok ok
[02/02/24, 12:13:17 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Vectorization is allowed. It's in sklearn
[02/02/24, 12:13:22 PM] Kavya Iitm: I thought of doing it before,but had a doubt whether we can use it or not.lemme try it
[02/02/24, 12:13:25 PM] ~ Prachi: Ok then
[02/02/24, 12:21:45 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Unique words without any preprocessing are more than 100k. After Vectorization you will end up having 100k features in your dataset. 
I've tried removing collinear features and my kernel stopped coz the dataset becomes +900MB from just 2MB. 
So, change the dtype from int64 to int8. It'll make it around 120MB
[02/02/24, 12:22:29 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Also helps model converge faster
[02/02/24, 12:22:37 PM] ~ Prachi: 900 MB
[02/02/24, 12:22:42 PM] ~ Prachi: 😮

Features after vectorization was 200k+

[04/02/24, 10:27:01 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I've been constantly working for the past 3-4 days on this and I hypothesize that there are various factors which hinders the great accuracy.
Firstly, the data is extremelllllly imbalanced which is why majority classes are being classified correctly but minority classes are being misclassified. Secondly, the independent features do not have much of a correlation with the dependent variable (ratings). Thirdly, the sparse matrix which we get after vectorization makes most of the models underfit.
[04/02/24, 10:28:37 PM] ~ ravi: What if we use some sort of 'k best' features from the sparse dataset??
[04/02/24, 10:29:07 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: How ?
[04/02/24, 10:30:05 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Hyperparameter are present in vectorization to reduce it
[04/02/24, 10:30:14 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I've done it
‎[04/02/24, 10:30:28 PM] ~ ravi: ‎image omitted
[04/02/24, 10:30:56 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Correlation is a wrong metric. Even a zero correlation feature can have great predictive power. Very easy to prove that.
[04/02/24, 10:31:37 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Over 100k feats to less than 20k
[04/02/24, 10:32:57 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: If dependent and independent vars doesn't have any relationship then how you can predict something ?
[04/02/24, 10:33:21 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: There's a reason they are  called dependent and independent
[04/02/24, 10:33:58 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yeah, they will probably cap it to the highest scorer. There's no way iitm will continue with the present formula🙂
[04/02/24, 10:35:55 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Classification: If graphs between dependent and independent variable looks like V or W or M, then correlation will be zero. You may still be able to make accurate prediction in this case
[04/02/24, 10:36:58 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Look at metrics like Gini, Info gain, Annova etc. Correlation is misleading when you look at overall data.
[04/02/24, 10:37:01 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Correlation is a correct matrix to consider in my opinion. If we take columns in our analysis that are not correlated or have very weak correlation with Ratings (Target variable), then it would just introduce noise
[04/02/24, 10:37:41 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Correlation does not work for non linear case.
[04/02/24, 10:39:51 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: In non linear data, the curve is sometimes going up and sometimes going down, so the average cor is zero. That's why I mentioned shapes like V, W or M.
[04/02/24, 10:41:26 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Friends, there is no point in trying a thousand things without analysis. Go beyond the obvious.

[05/02/24, 12:11:14 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: My highest performing model is Logistic Regression which is a linear model and correlation (between input features and the log-odds of the output) plays an important factor identifying the classes in classification. In that context I have used word correlation.

[05/02/24, 3:44:47 PM] ~ adityamalik: When you say you expect the score to go around 0.95 and saying iitm will not provide data that cannot reach S grade?
[05/02/24, 3:53:28 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Yeah I expect that they are giving us dataset with closed eyes. I expect that they have done some analysis before giving us data. I believe that it must be technically possible to get S grade on this data.

[05/02/24, 4:01:23 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: My calc was wrong: with multiplier, S can be obtained by 0.81 score.
[05/02/24, 4:02:02 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Without multiplier, it will require 0.93
[05/02/24, 4:02:31 PM] ~ Sonu Singh: But what am I supposed to do in EDA
[05/02/24, 4:02:34 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I am assuming 100% in NB and Viva.

[05/02/24, 4:02:57 PM] ~ adityamalik: Without multiplier
[05/02/24, 4:03:48 PM] ~ adityamalik: When the highest was 0.85
[05/02/24, 4:04:07 PM] ~ Sagar: analyse the data perform some operations on it  find features that affect the target variable
[05/02/24, 4:04:59 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I guess you are referring to past terms. I do not know about past formula.

[05/02/24, 4:06:50 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Then all my analysis will fail. I am going by what is listed in grading doc.
[05/02/24, 4:32:23 PM] ~ Hanan حنان🇵🇸: Hey I have a dumb question. There's no 'Rating' column in the test dataset given. So how are we going to test the accuracy of our model using on test dataset? We train the model on training set which has the rating column. Now we fit the model on test dataset and get ypred. And then we would ideally compute the accuracy score between ypred and ytest where ytest should have been the ratings column in test dataset which is not present. So how are we supposed to do that?
[05/02/24, 4:33:18 PM] ~ ravi: we create a csv file using ID and the y_pred and submit it into the Kaggle compettition
[05/02/24, 4:33:19 PM] ~ ravi: and the competiton gives us the score
[05/02/24, 4:33:47 PM] ~ Hanan حنان🇵🇸: Oh okay, thankyou

[10/02/24, 11:23:01 AM] ~ Vasista: Guys I'm lost af can anyone give preprocessing suggestions anything I do it's decreasing the score my highest is 60 😭😭
[10/02/24, 11:24:17 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Do you have a reasoning for why you tried those preprocessing steps?
[10/02/24, 11:29:13 AM] ~ Vasista: Well since I have text data I've tried using CountVectorizor and tfidf to figure out the most recurring words  / critical words in the Recipe_review column. I dropped the userId and and commentID I saw that  they did not contain any valuable info. I tried scaling the numerical data using StandardScaler(since they are not on a similar scale) .
[10/02/24, 11:35:07 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Scalling is helping when the differences are order of magnitude apart e.g one column has fractions and other has values in thousands. No need to scale cases involving 3 vs 98 kind of values. Why did you drop user ID? There might be a user who is always complaining. Did you check that?
[10/02/24, 11:36:39 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: CountVectorizer and TF-IDF should not be listed as preprocessing. They are feature extraction tools.
[10/02/24, 11:37:47 AM] ~ Vasista: Well we have userId and username , I one hot encoded the username, so I dropped UserID. So you are saying look for a user who is always giving bad reviews?
[10/02/24, 11:37:49 AM] ~ Vasista: Okay.
[10/02/24, 11:39:08 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: For every feature, we have to check if there is pattern of rating. Keep those features that have a pattern.
[10/02/24, 11:41:48 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: *Us moment
[10/02/24, 11:42:54 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Have you found any pattern ?
[10/02/24, 11:44:13 AM] ~ Vasista: Okay will try it out. Which visualization techniques would you recommend to check these patterns? boxplot, violin plot in my opinion is better for numerical data. But I am confused about visualilzing categorical data(all I could do is count plot). Also how what would you recommend to fix class imbalance? I've tried Smote but It did not yield better results.
[10/02/24, 11:44:16 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Not yet started. Cannot procrastinate any longer. Now the milestones have started approaching.
[10/02/24, 11:45:31 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: First you have to establish that class imbalance is the culprit.
[10/02/24, 11:46:19 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Just because data is imbalanced...it doesn't mean that imbalance is the main problem.
[10/02/24, 11:46:50 AM] ~ Vasista: Damn this feels like solving a crime
[10/02/24, 11:47:15 AM] ~ Vasista: Hmm will look into it. Thank you for your suggestions
[10/02/24, 11:50:01 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Very true. I use that analogy often.
[10/02/24, 11:54:06 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: t Test vs f Test syndrome: sometimes all features are insignificant but when you combine two features they become significant.

[10/02/24, 2:08:28 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Ohh, so test data may have different words so that's why mismatch? Am I correct? But why this issue not occuring when using sparse matrices?

[11/02/24, 1:00:47 AM] ~ adityamalik: Both are related,need to do atleast one submission to be counted as active in competition and submit your username and notebook name on portal ‎<This message was edited>
[11/02/24, 1:03:50 AM] ~ adityamalik: It seems this problem is arising because earlier we had to first join the competition and then submit notebook,but now that they have automatically added those registered, that's why this problem would be occuring,just a thought
[11/02/24, 1:04:57 AM] ~ adityamalik: These answers will show wrong for everyone,they can't program the portal to show correct answer for each individual different notebook name🙂 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/02/24, 1:32:53 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: WTH. This is the final submission ??
[11/02/24, 1:34:42 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Where's EDA and all they've mentioned in docs
[11/02/24, 1:37:13 AM] ~ adityamalik: Jan 23 term was like that only
[11/02/24, 1:37:50 AM] ~ adityamalik: That's why they focused more on how the overall notebook looked like and introduced level 1 viva for that
[11/02/24, 1:38:17 AM] ~ adityamalik: Earlier the viva was straight away with the industry professionals
[11/02/24, 1:38:59 AM] ~ adityamalik: Check this one,even mine is somewhat lesser
[11/02/24, 1:40:14 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Oh. This seems very unprofessional tbh.
[11/02/24, 1:48:19 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Yours done in a great way.
It must be hard to explain such lengthy codes
[11/02/24, 1:53:20 AM] ~ adityamalik: Codes weren't needed to be explained, atleast for me,and for quite others,they focus more on the other aspects related to machine learning
[11/02/24, 1:53:58 AM] ~ adityamalik: Depends on which proctor you get
[11/02/24, 1:54:35 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: But they've mentioned that students are more likely to explain their codes. Might ask you to write it from scratch during viva
[11/02/24, 1:55:51 AM] ~ adityamalik: Nope,very unlikely
[11/02/24, 1:56:15 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: What's the difficulty level of the vivas
[11/02/24, 1:56:38 AM] ~ adityamalik: They focus more on theory part ‎<This message was edited>
[11/02/24, 1:56:45 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: What kind of questions are being expected from the student
[11/02/24, 1:57:03 AM] ~ .: I have taken mlp and mlp project this term.. I don't have any prior experience in Data analysis.
Is it doable together?
[11/02/24, 1:57:05 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Like explaining algos
[11/02/24, 1:57:27 AM] ~ adityamalik: Again all depends on proctor,most would likely want you to go through your notebook, explaining what you have done and why,and not the coding as such
[11/02/24, 1:57:43 AM] ~ adityamalik: Other subjects?
[11/02/24, 1:57:59 AM] ~ .: And like bdm can we take two term to complete the project?
[11/02/24, 1:58:00 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Duly noted. Thanks for the input
[11/02/24, 1:58:52 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Is it the same with the industry professional viva ?
[11/02/24, 1:59:01 AM] ~ .: System commands and Bdm with bdm project
[11/02/24, 2:04:36 AM] ~ adityamalik: Yes,viva 1 only a check on how your notebook is arranged,and viva 2 notebook explanation and theory questions
[11/02/24, 2:04:56 AM] ~ adityamalik: Can be done with some effort
[11/02/24, 2:18:08 AM] ~ .: If I am not able to complete this in this term, is it possible to complete it in the next term??
[11/02/24, 3:50:26 AM] ~ Shweta Choudhary: I missed submitting kaggle username and notebook can anything be done now?
[11/02/24, 3:50:35 AM] ~ Shweta Choudhary: Will I not be considered even if I submit project?
[11/02/24, 3:50:41 AM] ~ Shweta Choudhary: Will I have to drop the course now?
[11/02/24, 5:50:06 AM] ~ .: I have submitted them but got wrong because I forgot to put name of note book in codes and I gave my student id (instead of roll number) as user name..😬😬   I am also confused!!Can some one advice? ‎<This message was edited>

[11/02/24, 11:26:58 AM] ~ 𝘎𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘚𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘭: Ok bro.. ❤️
[11/02/24, 11:27:18 AM] ~ 𝘎𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘚𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘭: Bro ur doing it this way or everything on the submission note book itself?
[11/02/24, 11:28:34 AM] ~ ravi: I just do everything in a colab file.

If i get good score there
I copy paste the lot to here and submit
So far i have not given access to admin , i should probably do it soon
[11/02/24, 11:39:07 AM] ~ 𝘎𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘚𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘭: Ok bro.

I have done three submission so far first dummy classifier not from this notebook .. second with score .772from this notebook and third with a score of .7802 from some other note book .. do I have to submitt all from the same notebook to stay alive in the project
[11/02/24, 11:57:56 AM] ~ Priyanshi: I think you can just copy paste the code of .7802 to the final notebook and comment the code of .772 

Or may @919784932897 can help more 🫠
[11/02/24, 11:58:26 AM] ~ Kavya Dwivedi: Don't worry about it...its the same for everyone...maybe because iitm can't define a correct answer for everyone

[11/02/24, 12:19:30 PM] ~ Ritik Ranjan: For milestones you just have to submit the questions which they ask in the project portal. Don't have to do anything specific in the notebook. For milestone 1 , I think the deadline was 10th of Feb.
[11/02/24, 12:21:40 PM] ~ Ravindra Naithani: Ok .. that questions I have submitted .. today is the last date I checked .. thanks Ritik

[17/02/24, 5:48:28 PM] ~ Milan Sharma: Hyperparamter tuning is supposed to take that much time.. If u want to reduce the time then u can do the tuning on a smaller dataset then use those values on the whole dataset

[19/02/24, 1:36:58 PM] ~ Sreeram M: A very basic doubt - Is this a regression problem or a classification problem?

I understood it as that I need to classify each review into one of the 5 buckets of rating (1*, 2*, 3*, 4*, 5*) and hence I need to build classification models like KNN or SVM

But why are they asking us to build polynomial/regression models? How do they help in building a classification model?
[19/02/24, 1:37:39 PM] ~ ravi: Questions are from previous term i guess
[19/02/24, 1:37:50 PM] ~ ravi: But u can build linear regression models tho
[19/02/24, 1:40:07 PM] ~ Sreeram M: Yeah
But these are regression models right? How do they help in classifying the reviews into the rating buckets?
[19/02/24, 1:44:57 PM] ~ ravi: U can make them work

[20/02/24, 9:17:42 AM] ~ ravi: Do all eda do all models be ready and give access to admin on 27th

[20/02/24, 9:27:21 AM] ~ ravi: Ull get 0.78+ with ease
[20/02/24, 9:37:30 AM] ~ Vishwatej: How can we get 0.78 + public score..i got 0.75 ..how can deal with text data in that..can u pls tell me
[20/02/24, 9:52:37 AM] ~ MEENAKSHI: I have dropped the text column.. would it affect how they grade the  project?
[20/02/24, 10:05:02 AM] ~ ravi: If u get 0.77 then anythings fine

But be ready to answer the viva sternly coz there will be questions
[20/02/24, 10:05:43 AM] ~ Vishwatej: I have dropped text column but I got 0.75 what to do now
[20/02/24, 10:06:04 AM] ~ MEENAKSHI: okay thanks
[20/02/24, 10:06:50 AM] ~ ravi: Text column is the very important part  right??

How can you  predict the rating of a review without reading the review???
[20/02/24, 10:06:53 AM] ~ ravi: Think bout it
[20/02/24, 10:07:12 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: You can't drop text column. That's the main column🙂. Without text column you can't even cross 0.76
[20/02/24, 10:07:25 AM] ~ Vishwatej: Yeah right
[20/02/24, 10:07:44 AM] ~ Vishwatej: Thanku
[20/02/24, 10:11:58 AM] ~ MEENAKSHI: removing outliers in certain numerical columns did the work... would this approach not pass?
[20/02/24, 10:12:24 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: How much score you got?
[20/02/24, 10:13:02 AM] ~ MEENAKSHI: 0.78
[20/02/24, 10:13:48 AM] ~ ravi: .
[20/02/24, 10:13:53 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: You have removed text column and still got 0.78? 😳😳
[20/02/24, 10:14:26 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: I am talking about final score on dashboard, not on train data
[20/02/24, 10:15:05 AM] ~ MEENAKSHI: yeah
[20/02/24, 10:15:54 AM] ~ ravi: Good job , learn the steps thoroughly as u need to replicate it during viva
And alls set 👍
[20/02/24, 10:16:12 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: 0.78 score after you submit on portal right?
[20/02/24, 10:16:35 AM] ~ ravi: Bro cant believe it 😂
[20/02/24, 10:16:51 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: True bhai, believe hi nahi ho raha😂😂😂
[20/02/24, 10:17:14 AM] ~ ravi: I got 0.775 with least effort, so 0.78 is easily achievable with some effort
[20/02/24, 10:17:49 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Bro, she achieved 0.78 without text column. That's next level🙂

[20/02/24, 10:25:00 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: First let's hope they cap the formula to highest score. Uske bina kitne bhi viva de lo, no use😂
[20/02/24, 10:28:41 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: 0.79 is the highest score and according to the current formula that person will lose 30 marks straight away.🙂
[20/02/24, 10:29:10 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: And lower walo ke bhi seedha 30 gaye
[20/02/24, 10:29:27 AM] ~ ravi: They will change it

Bhool ja bhai.. Change ho jayega

[20/02/24, 10:48:47 AM] ~ Anirudh: Someone on discourse forum said 31 mar is the final deadline

[20/02/24, 2:09:31 PM] ~ ravi: If u cross 0.77

*IF* the formula changes to 

Our score-cutoff
------------------------ x 30
*Highest*- cutoff


If the top guy gets 0.8,
And if u get 0.771 , u will get like 1 mark out of 30 😂

If this formula comes in place , its still bad as 0.78 guy gets 10 , 0.79 guy gets like 20 and the top performer gets 30 so 😂 , hope it wont ‎<This message was edited>
[20/02/24, 2:12:10 PM] ~ ravi: But atleast in this way the topper gets 30 , in their way the topper only gets 2.6 marks /30 so 😂 its lose lose scenario for us ( 0.78 > x >0.77) anyways
[20/02/24, 2:12:24 PM] ~ Ayush Kumar: Urge everyone not to improve their score 😂

[20/02/24, 2:17:48 PM] ~ Anirudh: I meant if we do the bare minimum for now and then improve after the first viva will it possible to get a good grade?
[20/02/24, 2:18:07 PM] ~ ravi: I dont think u can do that
[20/02/24, 2:18:23 PM] ~ Anirudh: Yes, everyone who crossed the cut off, please stop work immediately 😂
[20/02/24, 2:18:43 PM] ~ Anirudh: Right, so you're saying it's better to do our best and then submit only after that
[20/02/24, 2:19:33 PM] ~ Anirudh: Because I haven't really started the project properly and I have to work on other projects and quiz 1 this week

[20/02/24, 10:19:46 PM] ~ Anirudh: If you get less than 100, your score won't be scaled down to 100

[21/02/24, 10:34:11 AM] ~ ~A: 20 free marks if you get 100. On the other hand, if you get 100 - 30 - 10 = 60 marks, you gain 12 marks only (60*1.2 = 72) ‎<This message was edited>
[21/02/24, 10:35:03 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: 12 marks bhi bohot hae bhai😂
[21/02/24, 10:35:08 AM] ~ Datta: its not possible to achieve this score with logistic regression right?
[21/02/24, 10:35:35 AM] ~ Vyshakh K V: Submit in the sense where we should submit in portal,

Or just sharing and submit prediction in kaggle is enough?
[21/02/24, 10:36:48 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: That's what my doubt is. Just sharing notebook with admin enough or do we have to submit in the portal? ‎<This message was edited>
[21/02/24, 10:38:15 AM] ~ Asad Khan: I am getting this score by logistics reggerersion only. Other models are not getting cut off marks.
[21/02/24, 11:15:28 AM] ~ Datta: the max i could get with log reg is 0.76198, after tfidf and scaling 🥲
[21/02/24, 12:26:02 PM] ~ Yashi: are u all able to run hyperparameter tuning its taking so long
[21/02/24, 2:08:49 PM] ~ Pallavi Sinha: ‎~ Pallavi Sinha joined using this group's invite link
[21/02/24, 2:23:00 PM] ~ Yashi: anyone what to do in this case?
[21/02/24, 3:53:48 PM] ~ Aryan: Hey!!  I have a doubt... actually I submitted dummy classifier before a week... whose score was 0.77 ...Now I want made another notebook to submit my final model...what should be this final notebook name...??
[21/02/24, 3:53:57 PM] ~ Subh: Not able to give view access to admin, can anyone help?
[21/02/24, 3:54:38 PM] ~ Subh: Showing as searching
[21/02/24, 4:11:44 PM] ~ ~A: change the current final notebook's name to something else and the new notebook's name to the final one and resubmit.
[21/02/24, 4:12:16 PM] ~ ~A: or, if you are uncomfortable doing that, replace the code of your final notebook with the code from the new notebook (copy paste) and then resubmit
[21/02/24, 4:12:39 PM] ~ ~ KUNAL: For bonus marks we have to submit before 29th Feb , right
[21/02/24, 4:12:50 PM] ~ ~A: 28th\
[21/02/24, 4:13:12 PM] ~ ~ KUNAL: It's Feb,not march
[21/02/24, 4:13:16 PM] ~ ~ KUNAL: ?
[21/02/24, 4:13:39 PM] ~ ~A: feb 28th was the date mentioned. you are using logic with IITM. it is not going to end well
[21/02/24, 4:13:50 PM] ~ ~A: yeah feb
[21/02/24, 4:13:55 PM] ~ ~ KUNAL: Ok
[21/02/24, 4:29:21 PM] ~ Aryan: can i change the name of notebook after submitting it??
[21/02/24, 4:30:40 PM] ~ ~A: i'm not sure about how the final FINAL notebook is decided. apart from that, i don't see any issues in changing the name. best to post a query on discourse or on the gchat with your mentor
[21/02/24, 4:33:20 PM] ~ Aryan: I hv not any mentor but will try to post on discourse ..
[21/02/24, 4:35:44 PM] ~ Milan Sharma: Do it in the same notebook comment out the code of dummy one
[21/02/24, 4:36:58 PM] ~ Milan Sharma: The notebook which has the highest score and should be named as given in rubrics will be selected
[21/02/24, 4:38:45 PM] ~ ~A: aryan is asking what the cutoff date for the changes is
[21/02/24, 4:41:30 PM] ~ Milan Sharma: I don't know about the date but u can make changes any time u want even before the viva but Don't submit the notebook after the deadline is passed
[21/02/24, 4:45:00 PM] ~ Anirudh: Before we submit, we need to use 3 models in the notebook and the best one's score should be more than 0.77, right?
[21/02/24, 4:45:13 PM] ~ Anirudh: Do we still have to do all the milestones if we submit before 29 Feb?
[21/02/24, 4:57:12 PM] ~ ravi: Search for IITM

[21/02/24, 5:03:32 PM] ~ Bhavesh: What to do for milestone 2 ? Can I just answer yes yes to all and do that in kaggle after quiz 1 is it fine ??
[21/02/24, 5:03:45 PM] ~ ravi: Yu are correct 💯
[21/02/24, 5:03:55 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Ofcourse

[21/02/24, 5:17:42 PM] ~ Anirudh: It's not really about the time. I'm totally confused about the timeline and communication
[21/02/24, 5:18:09 PM] ~ Anirudh: If passes their Viva 2 before the last milestone deadline, will the portal even be open for them?
[21/02/24, 5:18:20 PM] ~ Anirudh: We should ask them to extend the 120 marks submission deadline
[21/02/24, 5:18:30 PM] ~ ravi: Good luck bro .
Hope u get good marks for project 🍀

[21/02/24, 5:54:19 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: And how do we submit our final notebook? Just giving access to kaggle contest admin is sufficient? ‎<This message was edited>
[21/02/24, 5:55:47 PM] ~ Aryan: Does train.csv data also needs to preprocessed like what we have done in train.csv data....during prediction ??
[21/02/24, 6:02:09 PM] ~ Aryan: does test.csv *
[21/02/24, 6:06:11 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: You have to do same preprocessing. Get familiar with Pipelines in sklearn.

[21/02/24, 8:05:41 PM] ~ Ravindra Naithani: Do we need to submitt preprocessing , EDA, 4 models with hyper parameter running and one model with score greater than .78 .. before 29th Fed . Is it ?
[21/02/24, 8:14:31 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: One model with score greater than 0.78? Where it's mentioned 0.78 ‎<This message was edited>
[21/02/24, 8:15:15 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: What is EDA?
[21/02/24, 8:15:57 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: And not 4 models, we have to compare atleast three models
[21/02/24, 8:15:59 PM] ~ Ravindra Naithani: No no I am just asking you is it the criteria to be eligible for 120 thing

[21/02/24, 8:49:23 PM] ~ Anirudh: They should just mark everybody on 100 at this point
[21/02/24, 8:49:44 PM] ~ Anirudh: or communicate properly in the guidelines doc and discourse about the bonus marks and exact deadlines
[21/02/24, 8:49:59 PM] ~ Soham❤: Dataset should be changed

[22/02/24, 9:26:57 AM] ~ Praveen Upadhyay: If I am using hyper parameters. How much time notebook run should take if everything is correct? I am using max_iter=500
[22/02/24, 9:32:50 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: It depends on the no. of hyperparameter you're choosing, model complexity. If the max_iter you're talking about is of logistic regression then it'll take around 30-40s for single model to fit on sparse csr matrix and slightly more time on pd.DataFrame
[22/02/24, 9:34:22 AM] ~ Praveen Upadhyay: 30-40s or 30-40m? I am using 
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'penalty': ['l1', 'l2'],
    'solver': ['liblinear', 'lbfgs', 'saga'],
    'max_iter':[500]
}
with logistic regression and it is taking more than 40m. I don't if it ran even after that I had to kill the session ‎<This message was edited>
[22/02/24, 9:36:41 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: If you're using grid search and there are 36 models fitting in it. It'll take 36×40 = 1440s
[22/02/24, 9:39:00 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Also, lbfgs solver doesn't fit with L1 regularization. You'll face error
[22/02/24, 9:39:47 AM] ~ Praveen Upadhyay: I am sorry, I didn't get that. Where you see 36 models in my code?
[22/02/24, 9:40:01 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Refer documentation
[22/02/24, 9:41:20 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Based on your parameters. 6×2×3×1 = 36
[22/02/24, 9:44:03 AM] ~ Praveen Upadhyay: Thanks so much
[22/02/24, 9:49:56 AM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Thanks. That's what I needed.
[22/02/24, 10:39:11 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Guys where to submit on the portal. I don't see any submission link or something on the portal?
[22/02/24, 10:40:08 AM] ~ ravi: 1.Yes
2.0.7606
3.Yes
4.5
5.Yes
[22/02/24, 10:40:24 AM] ~ ravi: Is this good enough for milestone 2??
[22/02/24, 10:43:54 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: ..??
[22/02/24, 10:50:46 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Guys also be careful not to use any nlp libraries. They have strictly mentioned any related NLP libraries not allowed
[22/02/24, 10:53:24 AM] ~ Ritik Ranjan: When I did my mlp project it was like this that they used to send a Google form for level 1 VIVA by mail to those who cross the cutoff and submitted all the milestones properly.
[22/02/24, 12:13:25 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Are you submitting your project ?
[22/02/24, 12:18:43 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Lately you were saying that if you aren't clear with the marking scheme, you'll not submit it. Have you cleared your doubts ?
[22/02/24, 12:19:55 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: 1.2 multiplier effect
[22/02/24, 12:20:47 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: 28 Feb : 0.77 score with 1.2x 
31 Mar : 0.78 score with 1x
[22/02/24, 12:24:03 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: If you top the leaderboard, you'll get full 30 marks. Is it correct or just another made up thing ?
[22/02/24, 12:25:16 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Imagination only
[22/02/24, 12:26:00 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Thought so.
Who said it ?
[22/02/24, 12:27:40 PM] ~ Priyanshi: This leaderboard will not play any role I think... They will have an internal leaderboard called effective leaderboard
[22/02/24, 12:27:45 PM] ~ .: Ye kaha likha hai, grading document me ??🧐🧐
[22/02/24, 12:28:35 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I don't think that's the case.
[22/02/24, 12:28:41 PM] ~ ravi: Me 😁
[22/02/24, 12:29:16 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Kahin nahin. That's the problem. They put such things in email and live sessions only. The concept of 1.2x has been around for sometime. It was there in last term also. They call it 120 bonus.
[22/02/24, 12:29:16 PM] ~ ravi: No that is correct , they always said marks will be given based on internal calculation and not based on leaderboard
[22/02/24, 12:29:25 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Ravi bhaiya 🙏🙏
[22/02/24, 12:30:10 PM] ~ .: Do you have that email, 
Please share, 🥺...
[22/02/24, 12:30:39 PM] ~ Priyanshi: They are not clear themselves 🥲
In last term it was, if someone submits in extended batch only those students will be marked out of 100 before that everyone with 120
And before extended batch they have 2 or 3 batch
[22/02/24, 12:30:41 PM] ~ ravi: That 120 mark concept exists,
I used that to get S grade last term for mad- 2
[22/02/24, 12:31:14 PM] ~ .: Seriously 😳😳😳
[22/02/24, 12:31:26 PM] ~ Priyanshi: In these cases mad projects team are up to date, but mlp team are just 🫠
[22/02/24, 12:31:49 PM] ~ Priyanshi: Ask anyone 😄
[22/02/24, 12:31:55 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Oh. Thnx for letting me know
[22/02/24, 12:31:59 PM] ~ ravi: But how will they implement gor MLP ?? No idea
[22/02/24, 12:33:00 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Ravi bhaiya 🙏🙏
[22/02/24, 12:33:41 PM] ~ Priyanshi: Don't know but last term many many students due to that 120 scheme got S in mlp project

[22/02/24, 12:37:06 PM] ~ Aniket: 120 marks was also for students who have took MLP theory and Project. That was one criteria as well.
[22/02/24, 12:38:12 PM] ~ ravi: Its not for theory+ project , its valid for 1 more term after theory
[22/02/24, 12:38:22 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: The documents they have prepared are overwhelming but everything is curated and looks as if someone had given a thought and effort designing the whole project.
[22/02/24, 12:40:01 PM] ~ Priyanshi: Oh that, that comes after every term students suggestion and all... When I did, there was less things to refer 🥲
[22/02/24, 12:40:28 PM] ~ Priyanshi: But yeah atleast they are making efforts 😭
[22/02/24, 12:41:46 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Not taking some aNgDu bangdu dataset and shoving in the neck of students and tying their hands with restrictions.
[22/02/24, 12:50:42 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: BDM project team have provided reference books and needful resources, plus they're also giving workshops on different relevant skills needed for the project.
[22/02/24, 12:53:08 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: They replied they will make decision based on final leaderboard and students performance. So if highest score is not so high, they may change the formula ‎<This message was edited>
[22/02/24, 12:54:24 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: So humble request for highest scorer - please don't score 0.9+😂😂
[22/02/24, 12:56:39 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Suppose, you are the one who can score +0.9. Will you hold back for the sake of others ?
[22/02/24, 12:59:12 PM] ~ ravi: I wont , coz i  know if i cross 0.9 everbody else surely cross it as well
[22/02/24, 12:59:44 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Ravi bhaiya 🙏🙏
[22/02/24, 12:59:57 PM] ~ .: Abhi  to 0.8 bhi touch nhi hua 🫣🫣
[22/02/24, 1:01:49 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Karna padega ab lekin.
[22/02/24, 1:14:06 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Finally touched 0.79 mark
[22/02/24, 1:21:11 PM] ~ Datta: how to achieve this? i have tried multiple strategies, the max i am getting is 0.7618 🥲
[22/02/24, 1:26:02 PM] ~ ravi: He is a working professional with years of experience in this field
He knows every nook and cranny
[22/02/24, 1:26:41 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Keep trying multiple strategies but the main jist lies in only focusing on the Recipe_Review columns. Haven't touched any other column yet
[22/02/24, 1:31:33 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: ???
I didn't know 1 year count as 'experience' 😂
I'm not a working professional bro, just a student
[22/02/24, 1:46:07 PM] ~ Datta: but the only thing we can do is tfidf right to process that column, no nlp library is allowed
[22/02/24, 1:46:24 PM] ~ Datta: i kept the max_features to 40, 50, etc, but same score each time
[22/02/24, 1:54:15 PM] ~ ravi: Did u try boosting?
[22/02/24, 1:54:27 PM] ~ ravi: Did u try mlp classifier?
[22/02/24, 2:08:35 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Tell me about EDA guys.. I see very little EDA being discussed
[22/02/24, 2:09:12 PM] ~ Ganesh P: EDA including preprocessing
[22/02/24, 2:11:23 PM] ~ Ganesh P: Trying models without EDA, it is like throwing darts while blind folded in a dark room.

[22/02/24, 2:29:37 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: The explanation lies in the data itself, why we're not able to achieve exponential accuracy. And unfortunately 0.9 seems far fetched looking at the current status. But I'll try my best to push this as far as I can.
[22/02/24, 2:32:58 PM] ~ Aditya: can someone suggest some good supllementry contents for ml project

[22/02/24, 2:36:10 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: First rush through all the lecture videos. Go to supplementary only afterwards. Internet talks about several tooks that are not allowed here. Hence, first go through iitm content.

[22/02/24, 6:51:59 PM] ~ ravi: Baseline model is actually a 'dummy' model
[22/02/24, 6:52:16 PM] ~ ravi: A model to build upon, dummy classifier in this case .
[22/02/24, 7:12:06 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: The word baseline means a "reference". It could be any model...the first model. It could be a dummy model.

The run is taking ever ending time, I may have missed some steps. Can someone please help in validating the steps I have done so far?
1. Dropped columns ID, CommentID, UserID, UserName, CreationTimestamp, RecipeCode
2. Used TfIdf on RecipeReview and RecipeName column
3. Used SMOTE for oversampling
4. Used hypermarameters param_grid = {'C': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100], 'penalty': ['l2'], 'solver': ['liblinear', 'lbfgs', 'saga'], 'max_iter':[500] }
5. Applied same steps i.e. 1 and 2 on test data
[22/02/24, 9:43:44 PM] ~ ravi: Have you checked your shape of ur train and test after tfidf ,if not pls do
[22/02/24, 9:51:00 PM] ~ Praveen Upadhyay: Shape of train data - (13634, 1186)
Shape of test data - (4546, 1186)

I have registered for the Machine Learning Project this term. Due to
personal commitments and carelessness on my end, I did not submit the
Milestone 2 assignment in time. I understand the consequences of such
violations and will ensure that this will not happen in the future.

I apologize for my mistake and request you to pardon me this time and
allow me to continue with the project.

Thank you.

[28/02/24, 9:55:45 PM] ~ Anirudh: Won't the milestone answers depend on how people do preprocessing? How can there be one correct answer?

[29/02/24, 9:38:54 PM] ~ Sonu Singh: Hi, my submission just crossed the cutoff and here is something that you can learn from my silly mistake and there is a bonus tip at the end.

Here is what I was doing:
1. Split data into train and test.
2. Use the GridSearchCV over the train-data to tune the parameters and train the estimator.
3. Then evaluate the performance on the test-data.
4.  Submit the predictions done with the same estimator. Score: 75.978%

But that silly mistake is step 4. Here is the correct approach:
4. After hyperparameter tuning and your best model ready, apply the preprocessing pipeline to the entire data from the train.csv file and then freshly train you model with best estimator on this transformed entire-data. Then use this model to predict and submit the score. Score: 77.276%

As you can see by correcting this mistake there was a huge jump in my score so, if you are doing the same mistake like me then, just follow my advice and try to train the model on entire dataset after finding the best parameters.

Tip: Hyperparameter tuning is a real pain, it takes a lot of time to finish, so you can duplicate your Kaggle notebook and run multiple notebooks at same time. Let's say you want to find the best value of the parameter 'l1_ratio' then you can have the value  0.2 and 04 in parameter grid of one notebook and 0.6 and 0.8 in another notebook and both running simultaneously thus taking less time to find the best parameters. I don't know the upper limit on the number of notebooks we can run parallelly but I have tested this with 2 notebooks and it works fine. You can also try that on colab and with different accounts. Therefore you can have 10 to 20 different  notebooks running simultaneously finding best parameters for your model.

I hope it helps. 😊

Can I still complete the project this term?
[01/03/24, 12:00:26 AM] ~ :): Your model is over fitting

Without bonus you can submit till 31st. 

Hope you have submitted the milestones!
[01/03/24, 1:40:53 AM] ~ Dhruv Pandey: My accuracy of the model is increasing but my public score in competition is not. What can I do??
[01/03/24, 1:42:28 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Well my friend, it's the common case of overfitting.
[01/03/24, 1:42:38 AM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Don't use tree based models
[01/03/24, 1:43:15 AM] ~ :): What choices do we have?

[01/03/24, 11:47:11 AM] ~ Satish: Guys one doubt. 
Out of 5 models, do we need to clear the cutoff in each model or is it just fine if even one out of our 5 models has crossed the cutoff?

For example, my Logistic regression model is giving me accuracy score as >0.77
But KNN model is not crossing this. 

Someone please reply
[01/03/24, 11:47:43 AM] Kavya Iitm: One model is enough

[01/03/24, 12:47:32 PM] ~ ~A: sahi hai. 78 matlab ki 29 marks toh waise bhi gaye. agar baaki 71 mein se 60 aate hai and if you multiply that by 1.2, you will get 72 marks total. that's a B grade i think. hope i have calculated correctly
[01/03/24, 12:48:27 PM] ~ ~A: @917978857312 and @917046882610 tum logo ka kya score hai?
[01/03/24, 12:49:20 PM] ~ Sagar: See I really don't think it is the case here . 
I have talked one of my seniors and she and he both of them said .

[01/03/24, 12:50:05 PM] ~ ~A: i hope so too. people are really struggling to go beyond 0.77, so even 0.78 is a pretty good score.
[01/03/24, 12:53:18 PM] ~ Sagar: Yes. So I will suggest to prepare for viva and ovio they have bonus marks also for 1st cycle

Then do we have to submit somewhere else to get graded by the 120m ?

Or something else has to be done?
[02/03/24, 1:38:26 AM] ~ Swastik Guha Roy (Orkut): Can anyone explain to me the three model thing... Like I have made one model and the output is submission.csv

So I write the other two model code too, have the output csv but don't make submissions on it?

Whether Registration is successful or not , dont care 🙂
I'll submit tomorrow tho

[02/03/24, 1:19:15 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Why comment the rest of models? Generate csv using best model
[02/03/24, 1:19:18 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Also, if hyperparameter tuning is also taking so long(>1hr), then comment it down as well, otherwise your notebook submission will take long time.
[02/03/24, 1:20:34 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Have they confirmed we can comment out rest of models?
[02/03/24, 1:21:30 PM] ~ Akshay Nanda: Then why do they ask for one notebook only🤔
[02/03/24, 1:22:27 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: We can have three models in one notebook. It's not compulsory to have one model only in one notebook
[02/03/24, 1:22:58 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: If you're making visualisations - comparing different models then don't comment, else it'll take so much time for submission of notebook as HPT and model fittings are very time consuming.
[02/03/24, 1:23:32 PM] ~ Akshay Nanda: Different models may require different preprocessing... It will be too much to put every thing in one and not comment
[02/03/24, 1:24:38 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: But we have to make visualizations and compare different models. So commenting them doesn't make sense
[02/03/24, 1:25:45 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: They don't care if it's take too long to submit😅
[02/03/24, 1:26:45 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: They want all three models with hyperparameter tunning and their comparison😅
[02/03/24, 1:27:38 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: That's true..
[02/03/24, 1:28:57 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yeah, you can't say it was taking too long to submit the notebook in viva that's why I commented out the rest of the models😂😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[02/03/24, 1:29:38 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I'll only go for logistic, svm and knn.
[02/03/24, 1:31:17 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: We can do one thing, once we got the optimum HP, we can shrink down our parameters grid so that it won't take much time when we re-run the whole code

[03/03/24, 3:35:28 PM] ~ Subh: What I understood is, in order to get bonus all the three model needs to be submitted today itself with atleast one model crossing the cutoff score.

I have the following questions
If I submit only one model then it'll be considered for 31st March submission right and when I can have my 1st viva (20 mins) after submitting only one model or 3 mandatory and for the 31st submission cutoff score for all 3 models to cross or 1 is sufficient?
[03/03/24, 3:37:15 PM] ~ Prachi: For example my one model is crossing the cut off score but my notebook is not organised + it's not properly done..
Shall I submit it I mean preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning is also not there.
[03/03/24, 3:38:02 PM] ~ Prachi: Means not properly done. Will IITM look that particular notebook only?
[03/03/24, 3:38:24 PM] ~ Palash: They have divided marks for notebook and model respectively
[03/03/24, 3:38:34 PM] ~ Palash: If it's not proper you'll loose 10 marks
[03/03/24, 3:38:45 PM] ~ Prachi: Ok ok

[03/03/24, 5:09:01 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: My understanding: It is not the model... student has to clear the cutoff. So anyone should be enough.
[03/03/24, 5:09:34 PM] ~ Palash: It's like you need to experiment with atleast 3 models
[03/03/24, 5:09:47 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Ok👍
[03/03/24, 5:09:47 PM] ~ Palash: Cut off is just for like filtering people
[03/03/24, 5:10:12 PM] ~ Palash: 0.77 crossed

[03/03/24, 7:38:18 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Same doubt. I shared my final notebook 20 mins ago, it's still not getting updated
[03/03/24, 7:39:20 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I think it may be a manual process or a script executed manually... definitely not every 5min.

[03/03/24, 7:50:32 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Just training different models is not enough ‎<This message was edited>
[03/03/24, 7:51:43 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: final notebook should be well commented and structured
[03/03/24, 7:52:18 PM] ~ griss: Should every model which has passed cutoff should be mentioned in the final notebook
[03/03/24, 7:53:28 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: My understanding is that you can edit notebook afterwards, but you are not supposed to submit.
[03/03/24, 7:53:39 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Seniors can throw some light.

[03/03/24, 8:05:53 PM] ~ Pranav Swaminathan: Okay, so how are we utilising that column for analysis? Are we using vectorizers present in SK learn (like tfid etc) or are we doing something else?
[03/03/24, 8:14:51 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Kaggle automatically picks up the top notebook. Is there a reason why we should manually select top two notebooks ?
[03/03/24, 8:16:00 PM] ~ Sonu Singh: It takes a parameter that limits the number of features created

[03/03/24, 10:11:26 PM] ~ Aneesh: Just a doubt.. this course has fixed amount of time for submission unlike the submission cycle thing of BDM project right?
[03/03/24, 10:15:28 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: As much as possible. At least 3 working models. Check the project document for grading items.
[03/03/24, 10:15:49 PM] ~ Palash: If my models are commented it'll work right?
[03/03/24, 10:26:55 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: I have also commented/disabled some code for faster submission.
[03/03/24, 10:27:06 PM] ~ Rishabh: If you don't submit today, there is no way you are scoring above 80? Is that what they mean?

[03/03/24, 10:28:06 PM] ~ Rishabh: Ohh okay. Got it
[03/03/24, 10:28:19 PM] ~ Palash: But I have commented all model except one
[03/03/24, 10:28:27 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: Theoretically, You can get S in both cases. But it is easier with 1.2x.
[03/03/24, 10:28:30 PM] ~ Anirudh: I've created my notebook and made a submission, but don't want to submit my project today. Do I need to do anything?

[03/03/24, 10:48:47 PM] ~ ravi: It will come shortly
[03/03/24, 10:49:48 PM] ~ Prachi: And which notebook will they consider

[03/03/24, 11:24:20 PM] ~ Anirudh: Right so the real submission is the application for viva?
[03/03/24, 11:24:53 PM] ~ Anirudh: All of us made the dummy classifier submission to technically everyone has submitted the notebook
[03/03/24, 11:26:53 PM] ~ ravi: If u cross 0.77 ur eligible for viva
If u want to take viva now, ur choice
If u wnt to take it later , ur choice

[04/03/24, 12:22:00 AM] ~ ~A: you won't get 20 more marks. your marks will be multplied by 1.2. since you lost 29 marks in the model, your max can be 71 * 1.2 = 84 marks
[04/03/24, 12:22:05 AM] ~ ~A: 85 marks*
[04/03/24, 12:23:42 AM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: They will change the formula and probably cap it to highest score
[04/03/24, 12:23:56 AM] ~ ~A: hope so, for everyone's sake
[04/03/24, 12:36:09 AM] ~ Rishabh: Got it 👍🏻

[04/03/24, 2:34:14 AM] ~ Ashutosh Utsav: Do we need to make 3 models with 3 different machine learning models i have made around 7 models but 6 of them with randomforest is this going to create any problem or not ? 
If anyone can clarify this ?
[04/03/24, 3:09:11 AM] ~ MoonWrecker: It will be better if you use different models.
[04/03/24, 3:38:12 AM] ~ Ashutosh Utsav: But it's not necessary ?
[04/03/24, 9:44:51 AM] Kavya Iitm: Did anyone face any issues with notebook registration despite crossing the cutoff and sharing it properly?

[04/03/24, 12:02:21 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: No. If you want to show it in job interview...it might sound good saying "top 50 rank out of 1000 participants".
[04/03/24, 12:02:53 PM] ~ Palash: Meri to 200 hai

[04/03/24, 2:38:12 PM] ~ Diya Parekh: Like those which we can drop
[04/03/24, 2:39:52 PM] ~ ravi: Even if u drop all columns and just work around recipe_review u are bound to get a good score 🤷‍♂️
[04/03/24, 2:41:20 PM] ~ Diya Parekh: So, which simplest model I can use for that?
[04/03/24, 2:44:06 PM] ~ ravi: Simple?? Do a lot of models with a lot of parameters

One among them might just do it 👍

[04/03/24, 6:25:03 PM] Hritik Gupta: I guess thats the only way
[04/03/24, 6:30:10 PM] Hritik Gupta: Are you all using PCA to reduce the size? Does it affect the accuracy?

[05/03/24, 2:16:19 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: You should have done preprocessing and you should have used pipelines. They may not be together. You should have a valid reason to justify that.
[05/03/24, 2:18:50 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: In practice we often do EDA is a separate notebook and modelling in different notebook.
[05/03/24, 2:38:23 PM] ~ ravi: What if i used categorical preporcessing and nunerical preprocessing seperately on different column transformers??
[05/03/24, 2:44:46 PM] ~ Asad Khan: Can we still edit and run our submitted notebook. to beutify it
[05/03/24, 2:47:22 PM] ~ ravi: yes u can
[05/03/24, 2:51:08 PM] ~ Asad Khan: We need to stop sharing then and again share with IITM?
[05/03/24, 2:56:00 PM] ~ Palash: Guys I just put my drop column in pipeline and my score improved

[05/03/24, 3:32:00 PM] ~ Lovin Tanwar: Yes
[05/03/24, 3:40:31 PM] ~ Satish: You should check your viva eligibility in the sheet attached below. Make sure all the columns with "Yes/No" options are marked "YES" for you. Only then you are eligible for L1 Viva. 

Otherwise refer to the column having "No".

If everything is yes, you should contact any of the mentor in Google Chat!

Check eligibility here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/5/d/e/2PACX-1vREFQ53o4H-rtMtOtr3Ly6E2-GFUJ2jVQmZt0e6EvNGF5GSCtHTcGa2MQluDAB5gfucMy6Mxh7CLzYZ/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true ‎<This message was edited>
[05/03/24, 3:54:58 PM] ~ Sagar: I checked it was showing no , despite I followed every instructions. Like on 1st March I contacted jimmi sir through discourse and he said he fixed it manually but still showing no
[05/03/24, 3:59:14 PM] ~ Satish: That's why you haven't received the mail. Contact them and fix the issue asap!!

[05/03/24, 4:05:39 PM] ~ Dhruv Pandey: If we're eligible for viva, can we make changes to the notebook and submit again?
[05/03/24, 4:07:54 PM] ~ Diya Parekh: Isme aur kya kya pucha hai??
[05/03/24, 4:09:02 PM] ~ Bhavesh: Everything else is same as given in portal like EDA more than 3 models etc
[05/03/24, 4:14:50 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: There is no right or wrong way. You should be able to explain why you did that. Just don't give impression that you did not know about that.
[05/03/24, 5:28:16 PM] Hritik Gupta: Are username and recipename have any impact on the prediction??
[05/03/24, 5:47:18 PM] ~ ~: Hey… what if I’m not willing to book this L1 viva slot now..?
[05/03/24, 5:48:33 PM] ~ ~: Will they give us another chance to appear?
[05/03/24, 5:50:02 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: To avail of bonus offer, you have to finish the vivas by next week.

[05/03/24, 6:12:30 PM] ~ Sagar: It is L1 viva so as per doc it is just a check list of your notebook
[05/03/24, 6:13:32 PM] ~ STUV🤓: can u elaborate?

[06/03/24, 1:47:50 PM] ~ Sreeram M: I’ve built the model but I’ve not built any histograms or scatter plots

What scatter plots are to be built for visualisation?
[06/03/24, 2:01:15 PM] ~ Palash: Any that seems fitting
[06/03/24, 2:01:40 PM] ~ Palash: You can create basic histo to check spread of all fields

[06/03/24, 4:49:52 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Also made it for PR-AUC
[06/03/24, 4:54:04 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: How the model was able to generalize over a single class.
ROC is not the right thing to actually see this since we have too much imbalance in the data. PR curve gives more realistic inferences on minority classes.
AUC ROC gives the score on classification capabilities on majority classes.
[06/03/24, 4:54:41 PM] ~ Palash: How did you guys deal with outliers?
[06/03/24, 4:55:18 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I'm impressed the moment I've seen MacBook 😂
[06/03/24, 4:55:42 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Used robust scaler instead of standard scaler
[06/03/24, 4:56:07 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Solved the problem like charm
[06/03/24, 4:56:34 PM] ~ Palash: How about deleting rows with outliers
[06/03/24, 4:58:21 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Upto your models working. Robust scaler isn't suitable for knn and algorithms which uses distances. If you're using knn then you can go on deleting the outliers.
[06/03/24, 4:58:42 PM] ~ Palash: Okay
[06/03/24, 5:00:58 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: You can also impute the outliers value with mean (or median if categorical) if you have many outliers in any single class. This doesn't remove the outliers completely from the data but reduces it's effect ‎<This message was edited>

[06/03/24, 5:25:24 PM] Lovleen Chadha Iitm: There is some feature which is strongly dominating others. No one seems to have detected that yet.
[06/03/24, 5:36:35 PM] ~ Palash: Guys scaling is decreasing my accuracy
[06/03/24, 5:37:07 PM] ~ Palash: 🫤
[06/03/24, 5:44:02 PM] ~ Palash: So I'm scaling cols with outliers with robust scaler it is giving me bad result but without anyscaler or using standard scaler is giving me good results
[06/03/24, 5:44:13 PM] ~ Palash: Brain is not braining
[06/03/24, 5:56:36 PM] ~ Pratham: So dont scale
[06/03/24, 6:04:18 PM] ~ Suga priya: Same for me @917652064884's approach might be different where it works
[06/03/24, 6:04:27 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Experiment a little. The cols that work for my model might not work for you. 
I've simply kept on adding cols one by one and seeing which ones are increasing the accuracy or f1 score. Once I got the desired cols, I put them together..
[06/03/24, 6:06:10 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I've done Scaling at the very end.....there are some other steps of preprocessing I've performed beforehand. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/03/24, 6:42:40 PM] ~ Debasish: When is the last date for submitting the mlp project? Is it march 31st or 12th apr?
[06/03/24, 6:52:32 PM] ~ Debasish: Sorry 31st march or 10th apr?
[06/03/24, 6:58:15 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: I think it's 31st
[06/03/24, 7:10:15 PM] ~ Palash: Then what will I do in viva
[06/03/24, 7:40:20 PM] ~ Palash: You are going to attend viva without scaling?
[06/03/24, 8:06:46 PM] Hritik Gupta: Are you the guy who crossed 0.8??
[06/03/24, 8:08:20 PM] ~ ravi: Hes close
[06/03/24, 8:09:26 PM] ~ Palash: Whos 0.8 guy he's not from course i think
[06/03/24, 8:10:27 PM] ~ Debasish: In the kaggle website it says 10th apr, though in the mail it says 31st march
[06/03/24, 8:13:52 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: Sadly not yet 😕
[06/03/24, 8:14:57 PM] ~ ravi: 10 days wil be allowed after deadline for 90% mark
[06/03/24, 8:15:53 PM] Tushar Sharma Iitm: He must be doing the project this term... He's using roll number instead of his name as team name.
‎[06/03/24, 8:31:09 PM] ~ Palash: ‎sticker omitted
[06/03/24, 8:31:20 PM] ~ Palash: Looks like I need to dump scaling
[06/03/24, 8:31:26 PM] ~ Suga priya: I m not attending now... and standardscaler is working for me
